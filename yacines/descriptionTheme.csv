"""The operation of potentially large numbers of drones at low levels, mostly outside airspace where there is any formal ATC, presents a number of significant operational challenges. For this reason, it is necessary to establish a clear concept of operations that is understood and agreed by all stakeholders. The research will include identification of how drones can be operated safely in non-nominal situations, without posing an unacceptable danger to other airspace users, or people and property on the ground.As with any disruptive technology or concept, the reaction from society will vary enormously depending on the perspective of the individual or organisation. Furthermore, the fundamental rights of European citizens must be protected from intrusion by drone operators. Consequently, this project will also examine non-aviation aspects of drone operations, to identify key issues for society and to offer solutions to ease social acceptance.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 1) topics a) to d).This project addresses those drones that are expected to operate in the VLL environment, covering many types of aerial activity, including leisure, remote infrastructure inspection, rural operations, flights in densely-populated and urban areas, and flights near protected sites, such as airports or nuclear power stations. Although manned aviation operating in this airspace is typically uncontrolled, it will be necessary to address how drones might operate within controlled airspace near, for example, airfields. In addition, VLL airspace is also used by other classes of airspace users, such as military aircraft, rotorcraft, balloons, hang-gliders, micro-lights, parachutists and so on. The Concept must enable safe interaction with all these users. Operational considerations must include contingencies and emergencies, and societal issues must also be addressed.This topic is not intended to address particular technological solutions, which are covered in ‘WA-2: Technical Issues’ in this Call. However, it will be necessary for the project to identify where technical developments are needed, and to quantify, as far as possible, the high-level safety and performance requirements of that technology needed to implement the Concept. The project should not propose specific technology choices.Since the Operational Concept is the foundation upon which additional drone research work will be conducted, the project will produce of a set of reference scenarios that illustrate the wide variety of drone operations that could be anticipated.The development of the concept of operations should take into account work already undertaken around the world on this subject in order to promote relevant global harmonisation, in particular NASA’s Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) research project, and work being undertaken by JARUS. The project should make clear any assumptions made about the volumes of traffic used to define the concept and any implications for its viability if those assumptions are inaccurate.The generation of a successful and accepted concept of operations for the operation of drones is a prerequisite for the development of standards, regulations, management and control agencies, operating procedures and business plans. It will also provide the foundation upon which technical and infrastructure developments can be made in order to allow the drone market to achieve its full potential.""","""theme"""
"""In manned aviation, the sharing of timely and relevant information, of guaranteed quality, is recognised as a prerequisite for safe and efficient operations. Drones will operate in complex low-level airspace where there will be other drones, manned aircraft, buildings and terrain hazards. It is essential, therefore, that aeronautical information and planning facilities are sufficiently robust and accurate to enable these operations to be conducted safely and efficiently.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic a).It is anticipated that information management will be as applicable to drone operations as it is to manned aviation, but it is not clear if the type of data currently available to manned aviation, and the way it is managed and accessed, is appropriate to drone operations. This should be investigated. Furthermore, the cost implications should be considered against the potentially more financially-constrained nature of many forms of drone operation.The range of drones under consideration is very large, ranging from small line-of-sight (LOS) drones of limited capability, all the way up to extremely advanced machines flying autonomously over long distances in a wide variety of airspace environments. Consequently, this topic should consider information management from the perspective of the many mission types that may be envisaged. A scenario-based approach may be considered to illustrate the range and applicability of information management.A project proposing to cover this topic should make clear any assumptions made about the volumes of traffic used in the analysis and any implications for the conclusions.There is likely to be a vast amount of information generated by the appearance of large numbers of drones in the skies. Unless drone operations are supported by an appropriate information-management environment, it is unlikely that safe and effective drone operations could be conducted. This study will identify drone-specific issues concerning information management, the need for integration with manned aviation, and explore solutions to the issues raised. In doing this, a safe increase in drone activity will be supported, and growth of the industry promoted.""","""theme"""
"""VLL drones represent a new type of air vehicle that operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional aviation. In order to remain safe and effective, they will require new technologies to be developed and installed on the air vehicle itself, or for existing technologies to be used in a different way, both of which should be safely interoperable with existing manned aviation.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic d).This topic covers technologies that will need to be fitted to drones in order to implement the concept of operations for VLL drones. It is recommended that the project proposing to cover this topic works closely with Topic 1 in order to promote a coherent approach to addressing the problem. Since there are likely to be a wide variety of drone types, operating in different ways, the project should consider not just individual technologies, but how such technologies should interoperate with other drones and manned aviation, especially when large numbers of drones are deployed. The impact on spectrum should also be considered where applicable.This Topic should address all aspects of airborne technology, including Communications, Navigation and Surveillance systems, Detect and Avoid systems, auto-pilot systems (including for autonomous operations). The Topic should include coverage of the miniaturisation of drone technologies and what could be done to produce lower-cost systems than are currently in use in manned aviation, including the use of non-certified systems.There is a wide variety of drone types varying from those small ‘toy-like’ machines with limited capability, all the way up to highly-advanced systems with performance very similar to manned aircraft. Consequently, the range of technologies needed to enable all anticipated variations in drone operations is vast. This project is expected to explore a comprehensive range of options for airborne technology across the full range of drone operations, enabling the growth of the sector and the safe integration of drones with other drones and with manned aviation.""","""theme"""
"""The operation of drones in VLL airspace introduces new challenges not encountered by manned aviation. Typically, outside the vicinity of airfields, there is limited infrastructure to support aerial operations, such as communication and surveillance. Furthermore, conventional navigation infrastructure may not be able to support the needs of VLL operations. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the concept of operations for VLL drone operations and to specify the ground-based technologies that are required to enable that concept.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic d) and e).This project should examine what ground-based technologies are needed to support UTM, describe its technical architecture and indicate its performance requirements. It should address the use of communications, navigation and surveillance technologies, and how data supplied by these means should be used and by whom, including the need for traffic situation and other displays. The complications posed by the operation of drones beyond line of sight should be addressed.The specification of data links is not in the scope of this topic, and nor are issues related to the performance of networks needed to support them, or spectrum issues for any technologies considered in the concept for any purposeIt is certain that the new concept of VLL operations by drones will need both new technologies and the re-use of existing technologies in order to function safely and efficiently. Correct specification of this technology will significantly facilitate the effective implementation of drone operations.""","""theme"""
"""Most drones, even autonomous ones, will need some form of data link. This could be for command and control, payload, collision avoidance, communication with the UTM system etc. Many technologies exist for data link from within and without the aviation world and it is necessary to identify which technologies are suitable for use to enable safe and efficient drone operations. Each technology places demands on both supporting networks and the electromagnetic spectrum. Given the potential volume of drones that may be operating, it is critical to understand the ability of scarce spectrum resources to support such datalink requirements, and to ensure that drone operations using these technologies do not adversely interfere with manned aviation.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic b).This topic covers all issues concerning use of data link for drones. It should explore technological solutions, their limitations, their relevance and their performance requirements, including usage of spectrum. However, any data links concerned with drone payload operations are not in scope of this project, unless they are dual-use. In that case, the safety, redundancy and performance issues associated with dual-use technology should be addressed. The topic should also cover the network issues associated with the use of drone data links, including options for implementing a suitable network or networks, such as use of mobile telecommunications networks.It is likely that drones of different classes will have very different requirements. A range of drone types should be examined, and a scenario-based approach may be considered.Data links are an essential component of drone operation. The wide variety of drones entering service, and the wide range of missions for which they are likely to be used, means that it is vital to ensure that data links used are safe, effective, meet appropriate performance requirements and do not adversely affect that spectrum protected for use by aviation stakeholders. It is essential to understand these issues and ensure that they are well controlled in order for drones to be safely integrated with manned aviation.""","""theme"""
"""The operation of drones represents a new challenge to society in that, for the first time, airborne assets will be available to anyone to fly, yet which have the capability to invade privacy or to cause distress and damage to people and property. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that the risk to the public is minimised by effective regulation, supported by appropriate technologies. Furthermore, it is essential that the potential for drones to fly where they are not supposed to is minimised as far as possible.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topic a) with regards to geofencing and f).This topic covers security from three perspectives:Security of the drone system;Security of third parties as a result of the operation of a drone system; andApplication of geo-fencing to ensure compliance with mission and airspace constraints.A project proposing to cover this topic should investigate how to protect the drone system itself to ensure that, not only can it be prevented from performing outside its intended manner through some unexpected interference, for example, but also that the drone could not be unlawfully interfered with in order to deliberately divert it from its intended mission.Drones have the potential to execute illegal and dangerous activities including, for example, acts of terror. This project will look at ways of reducing the risk of such unlawful interference.A project proposing to cover this focus should also examine the concept of geo-fencing. This includes examining the UTM concept developed in Work Area 1, including concepts for airspace classification and reservation, and examine options for ensuring that airspace constraints cannot be violated.This topic covers technological options for both airborne and ground elements, including navigation, communication between air and ground, in-flight updates, network requirements, service provision options etc.There is considerable concern about the security implications of the proliferation of drone operations. This project will analyse the problem so that security issues can be effectively addressed as drone operations are enabled. Geo-fencing can be used advantageously to allow or deny any action of a drone, depending on its position. Successful deployment of such systems should increase safety and prevent unlawful activity by drone operators.""","""theme"""
"""It is expected that, by 2035, our skies will go through a profound change. Where currently airspace is sparsely occupied by larger aircraft at higher altitudes and by small leisure and commercial aircraft closer to the ground, the rise of commercial & civil drone usage would lead to a much denser form of air traffic at VLL, with many more interactions between air traffic participants. This poses a considerable challenge from a traffic management point of view.The challenge is to find a robust and interoperable technical solution that is suitable for the smallest of drones. Importantly, many of these drones are envisaged to operate autonomously. The solution will have to be lightweight, energy efficient, and allow for autonomous avoidance manoeuvres even on the smallest of drones.In reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topics covers Section 3.5.3 (e) 2) topics a) to e) for long term aspects.This project will answer the question: “How can drones best leverage a sensor suite of state-of-the-art electronic sensors and communication devices in order to make a safe, robust and interoperable VLL UTM solution for e.g. detect-and-avoid that still fits on small drones?”The mobile phone industry has spurred an unprecedented advance in the production of small electronics, which has resulted in a plethora of sensors, processors, and communication devices, including small cameras, tiny radars, structured light sensors, microphones, and small communication devices. It is possible that, by combining these sensors in the best way possible, a common solution to VLL UTM could be found.For full robustness, the solution should involve both collaborative conflict resolution and, for where collaborative systems fail or are not present, non-collaborative conflict resolution. For non-collaborative conflict resolution, multiple sensors should be investigated and combined in a single, lightweight sensor and navigation package, in which sensor data-fusion leads to high robustness. It should also be investigated how this solution would perform in densely-populated areas, with drones flying in an urban environment or even indoors. Also, it will have to be investigated how the interaction should be shaped with a potentially very connected ‘Internet of Things’ environment.The topic should research sensor selection, data fusion and supporting procedures to fully describe the proposed solution.There is expected to be a significant rise in the number of small drones operating in the VLL environment, which is largely uncontrolled but still used by manned aviation. Implementation of a sensor suite able to be carried by small drones and capable of avoiding other drones, manned aircraft and other obstacles would significantly assist the growth of the small-drone sector and enable its safe operation in all classes of airspace.""","""theme"""
"""Infection with Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobe, is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in developed countries and leads to symptoms that range from self-limiting mild-moderate watery diarrhea to severe fulminant diarrhea, abdominal pain and pseudomembranous colitis. In some patients it may progress to toxic megacolon, colonic perforation and death.Over 500,000 new cases of C. difficile infection occur each year in the US and estimates suggest greater than 400,000 diagnosed CDI events occur annually in Europe, although the true incidence is likely to be much higher. Furthermore, the burden of CDI outside of the acute care hospital environment, particularly in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, is under-estimated.There is therefore a need to develop a robust assessment of the burden of CDI and current practices in Europe. Development of a detailed understanding of the epidemiology and clinical impact of CDI; more specifically to:These efforts can be expected to result in the support of adequate public health intervention and practices.

"""Reproducibility and relevance of research findings represent the pillars of the scientific method. For drug development, robust data and scientific rigor are key drivers for decision making, determining patent strength, time-to-market and consequently availability of new treatments to patients. Substantial evidence has accumulated that robustness, rigor and validity of research data can be problematic. While the issues at hand concern all areas of Research & Development, the impact of unreliable data, as well as the potential benefit of intervention, is greatest in areas already facing additional challenges, such as Neuroscience.Starting with a first pilot project focused on Neuroscience and Safety, the goal is to advance the quality and efficiency of Discovery R&D data. This action should provide evidence/data to develop quality criteria for new and/or improved preclinical tests, develop consensus quality management recommendations in non-regulated R&D to enhance the quality of decisions made based on experimental data, and by developing an educational course on data quality as a major contributor to enhance the quality culture in preclinical research. The action should also contribute to the development of a proficiency test system (ring tests) in preclinical research and to the implementation and testing of the quality principles developed by the consortium in day-to-day research settings, both in academia and industry, to achieve maximal cross fertilization and cultural exchange.These efforts can be expected to result in an improvement in the data quality of pre-clinical studies via the delivery of reliable and reproducible models with harmonized and standardized protocols and procedures. There will also be a significant contribution to the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) in the use of experimental animals in preclinical research, to IP protection and regulatory success by ensuring validity and traceability of data. Through dissemination of the scientific quality principles a cultural change and ripple effect should be triggered. Accreditation, consensus quality management recommendations, and an education module on data quality will further facilitate the implementation of innovation from academia and SMEs into the R&D process and will obviate the need for duplicate assessment of external partners.""","""theme"""

"""The central challenge to be addressed is to establish and validate non-invasive markers for classifying and evaluating subjects with NAFLD, and in particular to identify amongst those with NAFLD, individuals who have Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Identifying and validating these biomarkers will be crucial in furthering an understanding of the factors that drive the heterogeneity of NAFLD and in enabling accurate diagnosis of those with NASH. The ultimate challenge that will be addressed is to validate one or more NAFLD biomarkers that can serve as surrogates for development of clinically meaningful outcomes.The scope of this proposed biomarker collaborative research for NAFLD and NASH will encompass development of diagnostic and staging biomarkers that can separate NASH from NAFLD, and more specifically, identify the presence and severity of inflammation and fibrosis. This will serve to help identify the most appropriate population for a particular treatment. Secondly, development of biomarkers that can predict progression. It is recognized that in general, NASH progresses slowly toward End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD). However, there do appear to be subgroups that progress fairly rapidly. Accordingly, there is a need to qualify biomarkers that can identify “fast progressors” amongst those who meet criteria for a diagnosis of NASH. Finally, the ultimate goal of this biomarker research is to provide evidence supporting the regulatory acceptance of non-invasive biomarkers as surrogates for clinically important endpoints. It will be a long-term goal of this collaborative research to validate biomarkers that reliably identify and predict risk for cirrhosis and complications of ESLD (e.g. varices, ascites) and that reliably identify and predict risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is expected that this program to identify and qualify non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH will be transformative for clinical management of patients and profoundly enabling for drug development for treatment of NASH. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are the twin pillars that support medical practice and the unmet need that is present with regard to NAFLD and NASH cannot be effectively addressed without the elucidation of validated biomarkers.""","""theme"""

"""The demand for forest-based biomass for various applications is increasing. The markets of forest-based products are very competitive, with other regions (namely North and South America) leading in production efficiency. The European forest-based sector could improve its competitiveness by increasing the sustainable mobilisation of forest resources through better forest infrastructure, suitable machinery, consolidated ownerships and better management of undeveloped wood markets. Also, Europe needs a continued maintenance of forests, which yields benefits in terms of prevention of landslides, improved fire risk management, higher carbon capture by trees and other ecosystem services. A sustainable increase of the productivity of its forests will increase the value of forest land itself.The need to increase the resilience of forests to climate change is a common issue all over Europe where rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are projected to affect the composition of forests. The change in forest composition also bears consequences on the local ecosystem and biodiversity, as well as on the role of forests as carbon sinks.Increasing forest mobilisation and adapt forests to climate changes are crucial to avoid their degradation and to harness possible changes in their composition and vertical structure. These are needed to retain their economic value and to maintain the sustainability of value chains based on forest-based biomass. Furthermore, increasing the resource, energy and process efficiency of wood processing within forest-based sectors, could enlarge the suitability of the various kinds of forest biomass with a wider range of marketable products. Building on ongoing activities in the field of adapting forests to projected changes in climate, proposals need to demonstrate the techno-economic viability in forest-based value chains of breeding of varieties of current tree species as well as prospecting for new ones. This will require the plantation of several hectares of land. Proposals could also address the composition of forests by creating mixed forests with the introduction of allogeneic species. Forest owners should be involved in proposals.Proposals should demonstrate the whole value chain based on the innovations introduced.

Design for recycling at end-of-life must be part of the early development stages for non-biodegradable packaging material.The projects should cover any Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 3 to 5. In the case of a pilot scale project (TRL 5), proposals should present a credible cost estimate for the proposed processes with a preliminary assessment of their competitiveness when scaled up. The new bio-based material should be at a competitive price to enable subsequent downstream steps for the production of films and flexible food packaging to suit market applications.Proposals should also include an environmental and socio-economic assessment, for example with an LCA. In particular, when targeting TRL 5, proposals should include an LCA in order to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic performance of the developed products, with particular focus on the end-of-life phase.It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Consumers and producers start to become increasingly aware of the need to make consumer goods that require less finite resources and that protect human health and the environment. The latter is also the aim of the REACH legislation by placing the responsibility on industry to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances.

"""The organic fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) represents an abundant and cheap, albeit highly variable, bio-based feedstock. The advancements in sorting in the latest years have made bio-waste an extremely affordable feedstock (even available at negative price under some circumstances), attracting the interest of the biochemical industry. However, due to its high complexity in composition as well as the variability during the year, it is a challenging feedstock to be processed for bio-based applications.Indeed, its utilisation has up to now been limited to mainly the production of biogas for co-production of thermal and electric energy and compost. Conversion processes performance (in terms of yield, selectivity and titre) is hindered by the high variability of the input feedstock, resulting in the need of tailored sorting and pre-treatment of the feedstock. The latter steps reduce the presence of inhibitors for the downstream steps.

"""Bio-catalysis enables transformation of starting biomass into bio-based products, often with higher selectivity and catalytic efficiency as well as requiring milder operational conditions versus chemical routes. Nevertheless, to establish industrial standards of bio-catalysis, microbial genomes need deep modulation to boost naturally occurring chemical reactions or induce new reactions that are of industrial interest.The continuity of bio-based production, needed to increase the overall economic sustainability, is hindered by the drawbacks associated with the use of living microorganisms. Along with the quite long residence times often required and the limited suitable pH-ranges, the tendency of such microorganisms to accumulate mutations leads to a genetic drift which negatively impacts the production stability. In order to increase the industrial bio-catalysis production cycle, there is a need of microorganisms that maintain their bio-catalytic characteristics for longer period of time (meaning higher generation number). Also, further research is required to mitigate the impact of environmental microbial flora that may negatively affect the bio-production in terms of yield and/or quality of the products.Improve the techniques for microbial construction and control, leading to an intensification of microbial bio-catalysis for the converting biomass into bio-based chemicals and avoiding the use of chemical additives in the production cycle in order to limit the environmental impact of the process.

"""The chemical industry in Europe is facing a number of challenges that may affect its global competitive position. The top three among these challenges relate to the enormous growth of the market and subsequent investments and production in China; the production of chemicals and materials in the Middle East based on amply available oil and gas; and the ‘shale gas revolution’ in the USA providing the local industry a significant advantage in raw material and energy availability. As a result, the share of European chemical production has dropped around 50% in the last 20 years. In addition, major new investments in production capacity have been taking place in China and the USA, while chemicals from these areas are increasingly finding their way to the European market.To meet these challenges, the chemical industry in Europe has stepped up its drive towards higher resources- (raw material and water) and energy-efficiency, and has focused on business and operational excellence towards sustainability. While safeguarding base chemicals production, the industry has started to utilise renewable raw materials, making ‘drop-in’ bio-based chemicals to replace fossil-based products where justified, and at the same time making new bio-based products with new functionalities for initial niche market applications.During the past years, many successful production and subsequent use of bio-based building blocks have started up. However, their production and applications are limited. Aside from technical and operational challenges, there is a plethora of hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance hindering the chemical industry to increase its bio-based portfolio.The challenge is to make a clear overview of the hurdles in the fields of regulation and acceptance, set up a plan for their removal and agree on a roadmap for the chemical industry to increase production of bio-based building blocks for market applications that meet societal needs.

"""Effectively operating bio-based industries encompass a wide range of actors and stakeholders spread across several economic and industrial sectors and geographic locations. Each one of them has to-date traditionally been part of a well-defined value chain. This paradigm is undergoing major changes to incorporate the rise of new valorisation routes for bio-based feedstock.In the new bioeconomy, actors in bio-based industries integrate in ‘cross-sectorial’ partnerships within their traditional value chains, and develop new value chains that lapse across the traditional ones. One significant result hereof is that intermediate ‘by-product’, ‘waste’ and 'residue' streams from separate value chains can be utilised as feedstock in other value chains through biorefining. This will imply an integrated biorefinery approach and establish a circular bioeconomy.In addition, actors in bio-based industries have developed new schemes for cascading exploitation of biomass in order to maximise the efficient use of resources and the value of products. The challenge is to establish new industrial value chains across the EU (for example, based on industrial side-streams including those of food industry, urban bio-waste or aquatic biomass, etc.), crossing boundaries of traditional sectors and value chains as well as enhancing the exploitation of local resources. This will encompass the interaction across sectors with different expertise and new different business and cooperation models. With this approach technical hurdles will be overcome through cooperation between the industrial sectors and innovative technology developers; all actors also need to combine forces to address non-technological hurdles (for example related to policies).Clusters, being networks of cities/local authorities, waste operators, biomass producers (forest, agriculture), and regions across Member States, are instrumental to develop new value chains and support the development of new processes and materials. Establish cooperation and integration across sectors, value chains and geographical borders to develop new bio-based value chains and facilitate market uptake.Proposals should target actions on overcoming the existing sectorial thinking and proactively build bridges between different sectors and industries across Europe. Cooperating across boundaries of sectors, value chains and countries will exploit opportunities for symbiosis, synergies and complementarity in expertise and infrastructure.Proposals should coordinate with on-going projects and activities that address bioeconomy regional strategies.

"""It is expected that automated vehicles at automation level 3 (Conditional Automation) will enter the market by 2020 to 2025. In the past years, there have been significant efforts in research to develop the technologies for vehicles and infrastructure to enable automated driving functions. However, substantial challenges remain on the path to a European wide deployment. There is a great need to demonstrate the technological readiness, reliability and safety of the automated driving functions in a large scale pilot at European scale. Before the market introduction, it is important to test automated cars in mixed traffic situations, analyse the interaction between the driver, the cars and the traffic environment, study the behaviour of other traffic participants and get an insight into automated driving under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.). In addition these pilots should assess the viability of different business models to ensure investments are done by those benefiting the most. For implementing large scale testing, Member States may need to adapt their regulatory framework and solve liability issues in case of accidents with automated vehicles.The action will integrate and test enabling technologies for automation level 3 (Conditional Automation) and evaluate the benefits in Field Operational Tests (FOTs) for passenger cars. Possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation) can also be tested, although the focus of the FOT should be on technologies for automation level 3. This needs the active involvement of all stakeholders such as car manufacturers, automotive suppliers, road users, insurance companies, road and traffic authorities, the EU Member States, etc., because the responsibility and liability of all stakeholders relating to the testing, demonstrating and use of automated cars requires clarification before market introduction. The FOTs should take place in at least 3 different countries. Automation pilots for all driving situations (i.e. from highway to urban) are within scope. If proposals include FOTs on highways, testing across borders should be considered. Consortia should commit to make the data collected during the pilots available through common data sharing frameworks in order to foster further research.The automation pilots should consider all the following aspects:―Demonstrate the robustness and reliability (functional safety) of technologies, systems and functions needed to support the gradual progress towards full automation, in particular from level 2 – Partial Automation (human driver monitors the driving environment) to level 3 (Conditional Automation) including possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation).―Evaluate effects of automated driving systems (e.g. on traffic flow, communication, etc.) in a mixed traffic environment with automated and non-automated vehicles and under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.).―Analyse user acceptance and behaviour; study interaction between the driver, the vehicles and the traffic environment and behaviour of other traffic participants.―Focus on the in-vehicle evaluation of the driver under real traffic conditions in particular during the transition of control from the vehicle system to the driver and vice versa, e.g. expectations, adoption, acceptance, trust, usability driver position; human-vehicle interaction, monitoring strategies; investigate intended and unintended use of the system and possible mitigation solutions; evaluate fail operational solutions (e.g. emergency stop). Gender balanced representation of the reference group should be ensured and data analysed in a disaggregated way.―Conduct impact assessment (e.g. safety, energy use, pollutant emissions, traffic congestion, mobility behaviour, social inclusion, use of transport services, etc.) on real world data sets.―Establish a pan-European common catalogue on necessary characteristics of cooperative decision, planning and control algorithms, including self-adaptation and learning features and ethical questions.―Fulfil all security requirements to protect the system to any threats and avoid any conscious manipulations of the information enabling automated driving systems.Proposed actions may consider C-ITS communication and European GNSS as a possibility to improve the safety and reliability of automated transport systems in the future.The size of proposals will depend on the geographical coverage of the large scale demonstrations.Consideration should be taken of gender aspects and other demographic factors such as ageing, etc.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 18 to 36 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Growing road traffic in Europe results in detrimental effects on the environment and public health to a level that is becoming unsustainable, this in spite of increasingly stringent emission standards. In particular, CO2 and noxious emissions are not sufficiently reduced in real driving, while higher injection pressures have led to a shift towards the emission of smaller nanoparticles that are undetected by current certification procedures.Advanced technologies offer solutions but need to be further developed: on the one hand a new generation of engine components has reached a sufficient level of maturity but more research for their optimal combination in a new generation of engines is needed; on the other hand, hybridised engines where ICE are coupled with electric drives that are able to supply instantaneous torque still need to be optimised introducing radically new combustion processes to reach much higher energy conversion, thus approaching the physical limits.Proposals should address one of the following domains:―New generation of non-hybrid engines based on existing engine technologies (short term developments): proposals will address the optimal combination of innovative engine and robust after-treatment technologies as well as modelling and testing to improve the design and control capability. Special attention should be given to the assessment and reduction of particle emissions below 23 nm, particularly for direct injection gasoline and diesel engines.―Future combustion engines for electrified powertrains (longer term developments): new combustion processes, sensing, control and after treatment systems, supported by advanced modelling technologies where needed to allow these engines to meet future ambitious energy and emission targets simultaneously.

At the same time they should demonstrate real driving emissions at least below upcoming Euro 6 RDE[2] limits (with particle number emissions measured with a 10 nm threshold).―For future combustion engines for electrified power-trains, the innovative engines are expected to support the achievement of long term fleet targets of 50 g/km CO2 on the WLTP by demonstrating (on the bench with simulation support to emulate real driving and/or on a vehicle, depending on the starting TRL of the technology), a peak thermal conversion efficiency of more than 50%and real driving Euro 6 values with no conformity factor (with particle number emissions measured with a10 nm threshold.―Projects related to particle measurements will also support the understanding, measurement and regulation of particle emissions below 23 nm (with the threshold of at least 10 nm).Overall, research projects will contribute to the establishment of a future 'EU Super Low Emission Vehicles' standard.[1]World Light Duty Test Procedure[2]Real Driving Emissions""","""theme"""

Advanced physical integration technologies for high energy/power density battery packs should take into account safety and modularity aspects as well as related production and testing methods in order to maintain the strength of the European automotive supply industry in this area Even though the solutions for system integration depend on the properties of the cells and their control, the further development of electro chemical and battery management systems is not a subject of this call.Proposals should address all the following aspects:―Thermal, electrical and mechanical design of battery systems based on lithium and post lithium cells (if available on the market, excluding electrochemistry work) aiming at highly increased energy density and modularity.―Design for manufacturing, recycling and second use.―Prototyping and mass-production technologies for battery systems.―Demonstration of performance, lifetime and safety behaviour including bench testing and demonstration under real life conditions in vehicles.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 7 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Actions will result in:―Energy density improvement of battery packs in the order of 15-20%―Battery integration costs (excluding cell cost) reduced by 20 to 30%―Strengthening the EU value chain, from design and manufacturing to dismantling and recycling.―Contributing to climate action and sustainable development objectives""","""theme"""
"""Detailed modelling and testing at component and sub-component level (for instance in electrochemistry and electromagnetics) can be used to improve the understanding and design capabilities for higher performance and lower cost, allowing to recover or maintain technological leadership in key sectors of the EV value chain. Whenever the knowledge is fragmented, a truly European effort is preferred to help shorten the development and validation time of the tools. New technologies and new materials will enable further improvements in EV-efficiency but will also add complexity in control, calibration and safety analysis. Novel tools are required particular for covering the entire chain of integration into vehicles and subsystems. Consequently there is a need for advanced testing methods and tools as well as scalable and easy to parameterise real-time models for usage in different development environments in order to ensure safety and improve efficiency of future EVs and hence reducing development and testing efforts significantly.Proposals should address one or several of the following aspects:―Investigations on scalable real-time models for e-drive components (e-motor, batteries, inverters, fuel-cell, etc. ) that seamlessly can be used for design, simulation, diagnosis and testing based on existing models and corresponding test and modelling procedures to automatically identify parameters of these models.―Development of heterogeneous testing facility for electric traction drive and storage system that enable the functional optimisation, testing and diagnosis of new e-drive concepts at higher frequencies and voltages.―Development of systems and methods to assess reliability, energy content and commercial certainty for battery systems at all levels of technology, from cell via packs, vehicles to recycling.―Investigation on reliable and automated methods and procedures for parameter identification of physical and/or empiric models of batteries (state of charge and health, lifetime, etc.).

"""Electrification of different types of transportation and delivery typically in urban and suburban areas (including buses, vans, medium trucks, and specialist vehicles such as trucks for refuse collection) is a privileged path to reduce their energy consumption and emissions. At the same time, achieving the same range capabilities using large over-night charged batteries would undermine their payload capacity and vehicle performance (e.g. acceleration and hill climbing ability). It is therefore necessary to integrate either a range extender or solutions for the fast transfer of significant energy volumes, be it at terminals, loading/de-loading stops or in-route. However, large magnitude power transfer directly from the grid can be costly and introduce disturbances into the grid. Furthermore, large power flows in relation to the total energy capacity of the involved energy storage systems may be harmful to the energy storage systems. Therefore, the different options of rapid charging at stops and terminus need to be assessed and compared with respect to cost and their impact on the power grid. The overall challenge is to design integrated, energy efficient low emission vehicles taking into account the powertrain, energy storage and the charging infrastructure needed to cover the intended missions, without compromising on vehicle performance or comfort and safety of the vehicle driver and occupants or increasing the final costs to the users/customers.Actions should address the development of vehicle drive train concepts and energy storage (battery and super-capacitor) which can deliver the required vehicle performance and are able to operate in a pure electric mode with high energy recovery capacity. This will ensure zero emissions and low noise pollution either on the whole mission or in designated low-emission zones, while permitting in the second case highly efficient, low environmental impact internal combustion engine operation without range restrictions in other areas. Such technologies can be applied to one or both of the following vehicle types:―Electrified medium duty trucks for urban and peri-urban applications (freight delivery, refuse collection, etc.) capable of time efficient operation.―Electrified high capacity (at least 12 m) buses for urban use, capable of following normal timetables and when needed to effectively charge and drive at bus stops with multiple bus lines.For both above applications, where appropriate, development and integration in the vehicles, of power transfer solutions for ultrafast (< 30 seconds), superfast (< 5 minutes) and/or fast (< 30-50 minutes) wireless and contact-based electric energy transfer technologies, demonstrating how the system level efficiency and economic impacts can be achieved, including amortisation of infrastructure.To ensure the acceptability of such systems into the market, negative effects on battery life and the grid, and measures to mitigate them should also be developed and integrated in the global system, as well as standardisation and health and safety implications.Extension of these concepts to lighter vehicles should be taken into account wherever appropriate to enhance opportunities for exploitation.An interaction with interested European cities to provide input on needs and implementation plans will be performed targeting market readiness by 2023.Proposals could foresee cooperation with entities participating in projects funded by Japan and US to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies in the field of fast charging and its impact on infrastructure in view of establishing future international standards.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 15 million each depending on the number of developed vehicles and charging technologies would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.All actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by achieving the following targets.For electrified medium duty trucks for urban use:―Energy efficiency improvements up to 70% in comparison with equivalent category conventional vehicles are targeted, with full electric driving ranges of at least 50 km (including energy recuperation and superfast charging at delivery stops).―Low noise operation (<72 dB) allowing e.g. off peak delivery.―Polluting emissions below Euro VI with a Conformity Factor of 1.2 in real driving when in range extended mode.For electrified high capacity buses for urban use:―Bus energy efficiency improvements similar to dual mode medium duty trucks, with an average speed compatible with normal bus operation, depending on whether charging take place only at end terminals or at bus stops.―Polluting emissions below Euro VI with a Conformity Factor of 1.2 in real driving when in range extended mode.―Reduced operating costs competitive with conventional low emissions buses or trucks.For fast charging infrastructure:―Power transfer capability above 100kW―Transfer efficiencies above 90% for static contactless systems""","""theme"""
"""The energy efficiency of logistics and co-modal transportation needs to be significantly improved, since road haulage represents the dominant share of CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Adaptable and configurable complete truck concepts and architectures can significantly contribute to improving road haulage energy efficiency, by improving aerodynamics and energy efficiency, while contributing to meet future logistics and co-modality needs for different segments and markets. Industry, authorities and policy-makers should collaborate on standardisation issues in order to allow the use of configurable trucks in road haulage.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Actions will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives by targeting overall efficiency gains of at least 18-33% demonstrated on real platforms, broken down as follows:―4–5% improvement in energy efficiency by separate platforms for volume and weight freight, respectively.―4–6% improvement in energy consumption due to more effective loading space utilisation.―5–12% energy efficiency improvement (depending on traffic circumstances) from the integration of more elaborate flexible powertrains.―5–10% improvement in energy consumption due to improved truck aerodynamics.―Standardised interfaces and the resulting sharing of components leading to higher economies of scale.―The innovative front end design will increase energy absorption for vehicles and for pedestrians to ensure survivability in crashes up to 50 km/h.""","""theme"""
"""Growing urbanisation in Europe is generating increased traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution. Economic development requires an efficient and sustainable mobility system and European citizens need affordable and adaptable transport options through synergies between different modes. L-category vehicles, for individual passenger transport and for small logistics, are an effective solution to address the growing problems of traffic congestion in towns and cities across the EU. Smaller, lighter and more specialised than other vehicles, their use produces economic savings in terms of time gained, energy consumption and space required for moving and parking. Electrified L-category vehicles (EL-Vs) are a further step towards an even more sustainable urban mobility but they are still a niche market, mainly due to cost, lack of public information and limited direct user experience. However, last generation EL-Vs, and those currently under development, could meet mainstream customer expectations and contribute to urban quality of life.Proposals should focus on the demonstration of the potential market penetration of EL-Vs in different European cities. It should enable EL-V manufacturers to make vehicles more attractive to the general public, support a mind-shift and encourage the uptake of EL-Vs (in particular two/three wheelers and light quadricycles). The demonstration of EL-Vs as private, shared, or service vehicles will make the public more familiar with easy to operate EL-Vs and allow overcoming issues such as range anxiety. Enabling users to experience the wide range of EL-Vs as part of their daily personal mobility, will make them more aware of their real mobility needs and allow the integration of EL-Vs with other private and public modes of transport. Surveys among private and professional users should measure in how far the demonstration projects provide attractive services and match market demands.The scope includes deployment of ICT tools for driver support and services such as communication with back-office, booking, route scheduling, real time monitoring of vehicle performance to enhance eco-driving and for integrating EL-Vs into the urban transport. The scope also includes the compatibility of EL-Vs with other vehicles’ charging stations and with cheaper charging devices, such as home chargers.Compatibilities and potential incompatibilities between different categories of vehicles (L, M, N) should be identified and documented, suitable to serve as a basis for creating or adapting street rules, type approval regulations, standards and policy measures for the deployment of an effective charging infrastructure.The consortium should have at least two cities as beneficiaries.In order to maximise the impact in this topic, the focus of investments planned in these proposals should be on the demonstration of the potential market penetration of EL-Vs in different European cities, rather than purchasing the actual vehicles and their appropriate infrastructure.This topic is particularly relevant for SME participation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 to 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.As described in the specific challenge above, the demonstration will contribute to assess the potential market penetration of EL-Vs and consumers’ needs and expectations.Actions are expected to give details on their contribution to speed up the penetration of EL-Vs into the market and will supply the manufacturer with crucial information for the development and the engineering work of the next generation of EL-Vs.The work on deployment of ICT tools for driver support and services is expected to give the vehicle manufacturers and mobility service providers the necessary information to develop successful business models.Actions will demonstrate how the proposed innovation will contribute to quality of life in urban environments (including commuting), and will provide recommendations for effective policy measures supporting the deployment of EVs, as well as for an optimised grid and charging infrastructure, able to guarantee compatibility among different type of EVs.In addition, the demonstration will provide data on real driving conditions useful to design policy measures (i.e. optimal amount and distribution of public charging points, identification and possible areas accessible only to electrical L vehicles, interaction with other means of transport and vulnerable road users).Project results will also contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives.""","""theme"""

"""At present, the first generation of electric vehicles have proven their potential although there is still scope for future improvement. So while research and the development of electric vehicle technology has progressed well, the integration of new technologies in the existing transport system still requires substantial effort, mainly in urban areas. The sound deployment of electric mobility in European cities and the realisation of a certain degree of alignment require the involvement of stakeholders at national, regional and even local authority level, who are in charge of the legislative and regulatory framework. Integrated with, but not overlapping, the European Green Vehicles Initiative, the ERA-NET Cofund represents a new dimension of Public Private Partnership. It ensures that the complementary approaches and means of national and regional authorities are appropriately included and receptive to research achievement from the industrial sector.A European approach is essential to realise the ambition of effectively bringing electric mobility to the market: it allows key players to come together on a transnational scale; it helps to identify and to tackle the barriers holding back the introduction of innovative urban electrification products and services in the single market. Implementation of electrification needs to be increasingly based on partnerships that build the necessary scale and scope, and achieve greater impact from scarce public and private resources.The proposed scope of the ERA-NET Cofund on Electric Urban Mobility reflects the progress that was made in previous years and consequently sets a specific focus on urban areas, where the next important steps in the innovation cycle will take place. Proposals will aim at the innovation and deployment needs for 2020 and the years after. Activities should focus on demonstrating and validating solutions that have already reached sufficient maturity for deployment. These should be complementary to, and not duplicate the scope of, the other projects of the European Green Car and European Green Vehicle Initiatives. Appropriate user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take, social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. In principle all modes of surface transport are relevant. Urban freight and logistics is in scope (e.g. smart urban delivery fleets), but the focus will rather be on passenger transport (e.g. car sharing with EVs).The proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national and regional research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Call content should take into account the European Green Vehicles Initiative to ensure no duplication of funding.Participation of legal entities from international partner countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding[1] may nonetheless request a Union contribution to cover the coordination costs of additional activities on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost.To adequately address this specific challenge and generate a substantial impact, a call volume of EUR 30 million is considered to be appropriate (including a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million).Nota bene: Budgets should be determined in consultation with the respective initiatives to balance ambition in achieving critical mass and absorption capacity as well as aligning financial planning between MS and the EU.This action will result in:―Acceleration of the time to market of affordable, cost-effective and socially acceptable solutions to integrate electric mobility in Europe's urban transport systems.―Reduction of the environmental footprint and the energy payback time.―Strengthening the industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.―Tangible and practical guidance to the decision makers in the relevant authorities and support industry as well as the service sector to provide suitable and feasible solutions for electric mobility in European urban areas.―Contribution to climate action and sustainable development objectives.This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) and will be implemented by the Commission services.[1]http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm""","""theme"""

The goal is to further demonstrate the generic applicability of these architectures, platforms and standards and to identify where standards are missing or should evolve, as well as relevant pre-normative activities.Pilots aim at validating IoT approaches to specific socio-economic challenges in real-life settings. Pilots' objectives include user acceptability, technology assessment and optimisation, business model validation, approaches to sustainability and replicability. They should be implemented through close cooperation between users and suppliers with the active involvement of relevant stakeholders on the demand side.Research and Innovation ActionsIoT finds applicability in a broad range of industry, business and public services scenarios.

For this purpose the actions should address one or several of the following areas:―Development of novel technologies contributing to more electric aircraft, including new power electronic devices, low energy systems, advanced power generators and actuation systems as well as innovative power and power management concepts.―Advancements in core engine technologies to develop new innovative concepts towards improving thermal efficiency by increasing the Operational Pressure Ratio.―Development and demonstration of integrated aero-structures with self-sensing, morphing or multi-functional capabilities towards reduced weight and better aerodynamic performance as well as decreased manufacturing and operational cost.―Development of screening and optimisation tools aiming at quantifying the added value of alternative fuels from the jet fuel as well as development of design tools aiming at assessing the impact of different fuel compositions on engine components and fuel systems.Proposals should provide quantified assessment of the expected progress in terms of reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. Analysis of regulatory and standardisation issues should be provided and certification/qualification issues addressed.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 9 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.As mentioned in the specific challenge, reduction of energy consumption leads to improved resource efficiency, reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions as well as decrease of the particulate matter. Actions will contribute towards greening the aviation through increased energy efficiency of the aircraft and wider use of alternative fuels. They will mature technologies capable of:―Bringing measurable reduction of environmental impact towards the long-term goals of reducing CO2 by 75% and NOx by 90% (per passenger and per kilometre) by 2050 (baseline year 2000).―Facilitating the introduction of alternative fuels in aviation towards the long-term goal of 40% biofuels share in aviation fuels by 2050.""","""theme"""
"""Exposure to aircraft noise has an adverse effect on population. High levels of perceived noise have also an important impact on future extensions of airports which are reaching their capacity limits. Despite significant progress on noise reduction at source and on noise abatement procedures, aircraft noise continues to cause adverse effects on quality of life and on public health, notably in the neighbourhood of major airports. Ensuring that airports will have the capability to respond to the growing traffic demand requires more systematic approaches to aviation noise management bringing together technological, operational and planning solutions. To address these challenges, stronger coordination between national, international and EU research activities is necessary.Actions should address the development of new technologies and methodologies to enable 24/7 operations, including new methods for assessing, monitoring and managing the impact of aviation noise. They should also support the coordination of national and EU research activities related to aviation noise and consider possibilities for international cooperation. The actions should address one or several of the following areas:―Development of new aircraft/engine technologies for noise reduction at the source.―Novel approaches for assessing and managing the impact of aviation noise, including aspects such as new airport noise reduction strategies, novel cost-effective solutions for the monitoring of noise footprints and health impacts.―Integration of aviation-related environmental assessment approaches in land-use planning practices and tools with the aim of enabling a higher level of effectiveness in scenario- analysis and decision-support capability whilst allowing heightened proficiency for use by non-specialists.―Better understanding and testing of new emerging noise issues (e.g. sonic boom) towards international regulation.Particular emphasis should be given to innovative approaches towards reducing noise at the source and for mitigating the noise impact of air traffic operations. The development of well-reasoned and scientifically-rooted decision-making approaches for purposes of deploying the latter should be stressed, notably ensuring a level of end-user friendliness compatible with their utilisation by non-experts – such as land-use and regional development planners.The actions should support the coordination of national and EU research activities related to aviation noise, notably towards establishing a common strategic research roadmap for aviation noise reduction.The promotion of synergies with other industrial sectors which are confronted with similar noise-related problems is encouraged.In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged, in particular in relation to sonic boom, in order to contribute to the regulatory discussions at United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Actions will lead to new and more holistic approaches for aviation noise reduction, coupling innovative airframe/engine technologies with operational aspects, airport infrastructure and connectivity, and land-use planning solutions. They will also lead to easy-to-use decision support systems for purposes of elaborating sustainable airport development plans fit for use. It is also expected that the proposals will gather critical mass on a pan-European scale, overcoming gaps, duplication and fragmentation, create a leverage effect, enhance coherence and efficiency of noise research in Europe, and underpin the development of future noise related regulations, operations, and technology. By doing so, actions are expected to contribute to the improvement of health conditions of the population particularly in areas near airports and air corridors, as well as to economic activities linked to sustainable airport development plans.[1]COM(2012)497""","""theme"""

Multimodal safety management criteria for emergency management in case of critical events can be included.SME active participation is strongly encouraged.In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT[2] to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.Proposals should also foresee twinning with projects funded by CEDR's Transnational Research Programme[3], to exchange knowledge and experience and to exploit synergies.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Actions will contribute to near eradication of infrastructure-caused accidents increased readability and forgiveness of the transport infrastructure; they will prove the effectiveness of long-term, predictive maintenance systems; outcome could include guidelines for infrastructure responsiveness to connectivity and novel vehicle characteristics and safe coexistence of transport and other activities using the same infrastructure. The increase of infrastructure safety performance will also contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in the sector and will minimise effects on climate change via the improvement of traffic smoothness.[1]COM(2012)497[2]United States Department of Transportation (http://www.dot.gov/).[3]http://www.cedr.fr/home/index.php?id=260""","""theme"""
"""To make all transport modes safer (roads, rail, waterborne and aviation), an increased understanding is needed of the behaviour of individual users (in this case drivers, riders, pilots, cyclists, pedestrians and other transport users), and of their interaction with their associated safety-related systems and services (such as on-board technologies, mobile devices and infrastructure).The challenge is to study those key factors that influence safe transport user behaviour, both individually and collectively, taking into account demographic factors (gender, age, socio-cultural aspects, etc.) and societal framework conditions (changing living conditions etc.). Using the knowledge gained on the interacting parameters that define user behaviour and their combined effects, appropriate measures and systems should be developed and assessed to ensure safe user performance, to pro-actively anticipate user response and reduce the number of errors and potential accidents in the transport system.Proposals should address the following aspects:―Distraction and health related factors such as: studying the parameters that influence user condition (fatigue, illness, use of drugs, medicines, alcohol, etc.); distraction caused by using on-board and mobile devices; behaviour causing unsafe conditions (e.g. switching off safety functions, extreme emotions) affecting response in pre-crash situations; assessment of the psychological condition of those in charge of vehicles/vessels; and identification and development of suitable mitigation measures.―Social and demographic factors such as: variations in safety behaviour, socio-cultural issues, gender, age and disability and their impact on risk assessment and exposure of each individual or group; and identification and development of measures to address these factors and reduce their impact.―Risk appraisal such as: development of analysis and assessment methods for factors affecting the level of risk users are willing to take, e.g. the ability to judge and manage conditions like weather, infrastructure condition and traffic levels; and development of means to reduce hazardous risk taking.―Measures to modify transport user behaviour such as: novel enforcement and incentive schemes for high risk groups; focused and coordinated training schemes and tools for transport users based on reliable interaction and behavioural models piloted widely across different types of traffic and geographical regions; analysis of changes in users' behaviour from first use to familiarisation and confidence in new safety assistance systems.Extensive knowledge on user behaviour has been developed within each transport mode, e.g. mental overload for pilots, the effect of shift rotation on train driver response time. Transfer of knowledge between transport modes and an effective deployment of multi-modal solutions are recommended, as well as the inclusion of non-traditional transport modes, such as personal mobility devices.Active participation of SMEs is strongly encouraged.In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with industrialised countries (i.e. US, Japan, Canada, Australia) and emerging economies (primarily China, India, Brazil).

"""Road safety in Africa represents a dramatic problem per se – 300,000 fatalities and over 5 million injured per year – with vast negative social and economic impacts: on the livelihood of African families, on the public health systems, on the very prospects of poverty reduction and economic development. The state of road infrastructure and vehicles, the insufficient deployment of modern traffic management systems, the inadequate legal and regulatory framework, the weak enforcement of safety measures, the lack of trained staff, the widespread improper behaviour of road users, the insufficient public awareness, are all factors that contribute to making Africa’s record on road safety the worst in the world.This Euro-African R&I initiative on road safety and traffic management is meant to bring together the key players and the best available expertise on both sides; and to complement existing activities at local, bi-regional and international level, drawing lessons from their implementation and building upon their achievements. The ultimate purpose is to promote the adoption of sound innovative solutions to address safety concerns and improve mobility in Africa, particularly in urban areas and along the main corridors, in line with the goals of the African Road Safety Charter. The initiative takes the form of a Coordination and Support Action encompassing two components. Proposals should address these two components together:1) The action will set up a dialogue platform involving African and European national road safety authorities and experts, with the participation of representatives of the African Union Commission, the African Regional Economic Communities and the relevant international organisations. The platform should serve the purpose of comparing methodologies and disseminating best practice, promoting knowledge transfer and collaboration, and assessing progress towards the objectives of the African Road Safety Action Plan 2020.2) The action will produce evidence gathering and data collection, as well as analysis of risk factors (speed, drinking, lack of user protection devices, etc.), allowing a factual appraisal of the problems at stake and a mapping of the critical areas and challenges. It will analyse the most appropriate road safety assessment methodologies and management systems, and define criteria for measuring future progress. It will also identify requirements for skills development and training of staff, and research and innovation needs, with a view to quick deployment of suitable solutions.A balanced participation of European and African partners in these activities is expected, also with the aim of reinforcing endogenous African capabilities, and will be taken into account in the evaluation of proposals.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 3.0 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.In line with the Sustainable Development Goals and with the principles of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy (JAES), the activities to be implemented will contribute to:―The improvement of road safety and traffic fluidity conditions in Africa, ultimately saving thousands of lives and lessening the human, social and economic burden of road accidents.―The reinforcement of endogenous African capabilities with a view to long term sustainable progress in the fight against road casualties and for a more efficient and sustainable transport system.―The dissemination of European know-how and the deployment of sound technical and governance solutions.This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) and will be implemented by the Commission services.""","""theme"""

The specific challenge is to increase the take up of innovative solutions by transferring them to new contexts and studying and comparing the impacts. Special attention should be paid to social issues and implications. Where relevant, potential gender differences should be investigated.Proposals should address one or several of the following domains:―Traffic and travel avoidance: planning and location policy; innovative demand management approaches while providing citizens, businesses and organisations with minimum levels of access; less car dependent lifestyles.―Optimising the use of existing infrastructure and vehicles: this may include smart pricing of parking, public transport and road use; increasing load factors and making the last mile more efficient in urban freight transport; integration between urban freight and passengers transport networks within appropriate city and transport planning governance; innovative use of passenger transport means; planning for increasing the resilience of the urban transport system to extreme weather events.―Optimising design and use of multi-modals hubs and terminals for passengers and freight; integration of systems, (sustainable) modes and 'mobility as a service', more efficient transfers; transformation of districts; multi-purpose use of space for vehicles.―Supporting modal shift towards more efficient modes: increased walking and cycling; urban waterborne transport; mobility management and travel awareness; increased attractiveness of public transport; new coordination and service concepts.―New governance models for freight and passenger transport: better coordination and cooperation; synergies between passenger and freight transport; stakeholder engagement; public consultation and participation; education and training, policy transfer.ITS solutions are covered in other topics of the Transport Challenge Work Programme and in other parts of Horizon 2020, but the integration of IT and ITS enablers for urban mobility measures needs to be fully considered.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""In order to integrate electromobility in their Sustainable Mobility Plans, European cities need to equip themselves with a network of electric recharging stations for electric cars and L-category vehicles. This will help the market to grow, as potentially interested consumers tend not to buy electric vehicles[1] because they are not confident enough about the opportunities to recharge them. However, the real business models do not yet exist. The establishment of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles is expensive and, without additional financial support and/or new approaches, there is a first-mover disadvantage until there are enough vehicles to make the investments profitable.Proposals should focus on the development of integrated approaches and testing of ""business"" models for the local production and distribution of electricity together with electric vehicles fleet, to create the conditions for market take up in urban and sub-urban areas. This could include private and public recharging stations. Approaches could include e.g. charging at work places, private parking places, homes, public spaces, transport intermodal hubs, system integration of large fleets of electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs), multimodal platforms, etc. Specific tests and pilots focussing on the integration of solutions into transport system, in combination with a cross-site evaluation, could be carried out. Possible barriers and ways to overcome these barriers to deploy integrated solutions and business models for electric recharging should be identified. Where relevant, potential gender differences should be investigated.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 to 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.In order to maximise the impact in this topic, the focus of investments planned in these proposals should be on developing integrated approaches and testing of business models, rather than purchasing the actual clean vehicles and their appropriate infrastructure.Tested and validated business models for electromobility solutions regarding:―Large scale, sustainable and decentralised energy production and distribution (also from transport infrastructure itself) in balance with local use.―Simple, interoperable, convenient and intelligent billing systems ensuring at the same time a safe and reliable data exchange in cities. This includes integrated energy infrastructure systems, bringing together technologies from the energy, infrastructure and transport domains.―Emergent integrated approaches and business models for recharging, looking – among others – at consumer acceptance, value models and ownership.―Projects should bring innovative tools and recommendations to integrate electromobility in SUMPs (for example, planning policies and use of urban space), as well as recommendations for common standards of ultra-low emissions urban areas.―On the basis of clear commitments from participants for a further Europe-wide take-up and rollout of results during and following the project are expected.The project proposal should include an estimation of CO2 savings obtained through the sustainable urban mobility solutions deployed in the project, on the basis of CO2 intensity of the European electricity grid of 540 g CO2/kW-h[2].

These expert networks could focus on how to deploy novel combinations of existing technologies/ services and involve new combinations of different stakeholder groupings, for example from research and innovation programmes, from urban planning, from infrastructure constructors and operators and from financiers, with a great emphasis on creating synergies between results of Horizon 2020 funded projects and CEF funding.This topic will complement topic MG-5.1-2016 (Networked and efficient logistics clusters) in this Work Programme.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Market demand for sustainable urban mobility solutions can be boosted by increasing purchaser (and indirectly end-user) awareness about technologies and processes used in implementing sustainable urban solutions. Urban areas concentrate demand for sustainable transport and mobility solutions (such as alternatively fuelled vehicles and supporting (refuelling) infrastructure) by public procurers. The procurement of innovation can support the broad market take-up of innovative solutions through the jointly planning (across borders) demand created by public procurers.Under this topic, support should be provided for the establishment of a number of cross-border networking activities that plan future public procurements of innovation (PPI[1]) and/or pre-commercial procurements (PCP[2]) of solutions that result in sustainable urban mobility, including vehicles corresponding to alternative fuels infrastructure as legislated in Directive 2014/94. Also actions funded here could complement those funded in the ELENA instrument in two ways: the preparatory public procurement activities funded in this topic could lead to ELENA applications, or the implementation of an ELENA action could be supported as part of the actions funded in this topic.Proposals should be driven by clearly identified needs of the procurers, including life-cycle and cost-benefit assessments. It is envisaged that there will be a fairly small (about 5-10 organisations) consortium of public procurers that organises dissemination activities for a larger group of public procurers.

These could include improving access to mobility solutions, to healthcare, education, jobs and for businesses and sustainable lifestyles; behaviours, reducing greenhouse emissions from mobility, reducing noise, increasing the use of alternative fuelled vehicles and public/shared transport and safety issues.

"""Ongoing research efforts show that the translation of the working principles of the Digital Internet to the routing of freight, thus creating the Physical Internet (PI), has the potential to be a real game-changer.

Each parcel is routed automatically and at each section it is bundled for efficiency. In the PI network of networks many (if not all) transport and logistics services would be accessible on demand to all users.This will however require the successful integration of many innovative concepts and non-the-least the mental-shift to adopt a very different governance structure.

"""Ongoing research efforts show that the translation of the working principles of the Digital Internet to the routing of freight, thus creating the Physical Internet (PI), has the potential to be a real game-changer. In the PI world freight travels from hub to hub in an open network rather than from origin to destination directly. Each parcel is routed automatically and at each section it is bundled for efficiency. In the PI network of networks many (if not all) transport and logistics services would be accessible on demand to all users.This will however require the successful integration of many innovative concepts and non-the-least the mental-shift to adopt a very different governance structure. The Internet of Things for example, which could link every future container, load unit or parcel to the internet, can be considered a pre-requisite for the Physical Internet to work as there will be an increased need to track all goods in a freight environment lacking a fixed and known transport route. The main challenge is to model a future Physical Internet network topology and assess the benefits it could generate in terms of carbon footprint, throughput times and cost reductions.

"""Full implementation of ITS will allow advanced capabilities across national boundaries and transport modes, to respond to multiple users’ needs and enable improved travel performance. Analysis and development of coherent concepts, encompassing all relevant elements, systems and services to bring Europe's transport system towards a more user-centric, digital and intelligent mobility model (e.g. mobility as a service) to make advanced travel planning a reality need to be ensured. Utilisation of open data (produced by both the public and private sector) in the establishment of novel services is a key element. Data protection must also be ensured. A paradigm change in transportation is expected to take place through mobility as a service, where the service providers could offer travellers easy, flexible, reliable, price-worthy and environmentally sustainable everyday travel, including for example public transport, car-sharing, car leasing and road use, as well as more efficient goods shipping and delivery possibilities. Although activities in this field are on-going in some of the EU Member States, at present, there is no quantifiable evidence on its costs and benefits, as well as on its influence on travel patterns and behaviour of the end users.Evidence-based decision support is needed, for full utilisation of data and automation as an integral part of the transport system, to facilitate the development of mobility service business models and innovative financing, pricing and taxation methods to steer users to choose smart mobility, as well as linking transport, communications and energy networks together to support an effective and socio-economically pertinent deployment of novel transport services.In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address several of the following aspects:―Multi-modal, cross-border traffic management, information and planning systems to serve passengers and/or other users.―Analysis of the range of services to be made accessible under each interface, by taking into account differences in preferences and behaviour between various user groups.―Identification of the success and failure factors (technological, economic and socio-cultural) of the new concept(s), such as mobility as a service, with particular attention to the users' acceptance factors.―Identification of the necessary framework (regulatory, technological, financial, etc.) to support the implementation of new services, including the needed private-public collaboration requirements.―Identification and development of viable business models suitable for future market take-up.―Identification and validation of measures apt to induce socially-responsible (e.g. vis-à-vis the environment and the community at large) travel behaviours and advanced planning (e.g. via integrated intermodal paperless ticketing).Participation of SMEs with proven experience in these areas is encouraged.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 to 3.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Despite a number of ITS developments in recent years, several initiatives were undertaken in very specific environments, on an ad-hoc, isolated local or national basis, focusing mostly within a particular transport mode (e.g. Road). On top of this, the cooperative dimension of ITS and the applicability in different settings (e.g. urban, highway, long-distance, etc.) has so far not been sufficiently addressed. The time has come to bring this all together, leverage the achievements of past and current pilots and perform large-scale, real-life demonstrations in a specific (for example highly dense population) or combinations of environments that would not only showcase the current status of development and the large potential of C-ITS, but also reveal key areas for future research, innovation and deployment-related issues. A challenge towards full deployment of C-ITS remains the lack of a detailed testing methodology to validate developments of cooperative services and architectures.An integral part of this challenge is the demonstration of functioning partnerships of multiple stakeholders, namely private (including telecom, infrastructure and transport service operators and service providers, and Original Equipment Manufacturers), public authorities, emergency services, and other stakeholder groups and users, including a proof of actual commitment from the test sites. It should also be supported by thorough post-demonstration impact and cost-benefit assessment and evaluation of C-ITS concepts and technologies, including implementation issues. This will also offer an opportunity for stakeholders and partners to address issues and identify relevant technologies, including European GNSS, and processes to develop operational systems to be kept in place beyond the life of the pilot and lead towards automated transport. In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address several of the following aspects:―Enable services based on appropriate access and sharing of data leveraging in-vehicle resources and 2-way V2V, V2I, I2I and vulnerable road users connectivity in complex urban environments.―Enable interoperability across systems including testing and validating standards.―Demonstrating and validating cross-modal integration (e.g. including crossing) and potential for cross-border inter-operability. Interconnected and independent systems should be developed taking account of existing European and international standards and platforms.Participation of SMEs with proven experience in these areas is encouraged.Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US, to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies, particularly for the development of validation methodologies.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 11 to 13 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Actions are expected to lead to:―Improved level of performance for the entire transport system, including more efficient traffic management and safety improvements to enable a more sustainable transport system and foster overall socio-economic development.―Fully integrated C-ITS concepts in practical, real-life, complex environments being tested and demonstrated.―Greater collaboration (and partnerships) between multiple stakeholders to deploy applications and facilitate the interoperable interactions across all elements of the transport system, including the use of data from multiple sources (e.g. vehicle, mobile device and infrastructure).―A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the pilot that demonstrates the value added and economic viability of C-ITS services and solutions for users and other stakeholders.―Validated results and proven impact on user acceptance, safety, resilience and security with respect to transport demand and the environment.""","""theme"""

"""Technological developments, particularly related to the extended and expanding use of ICT in the transport sector, allow the collection of unprecedented volumes of data across all modes and transport systems. These volumes of data, known also as ""big data"", have generated a strong interest in the transport research community as well as in the relevant industries and among policy makers.From freight transport and supply chain optimisation to evacuation modelling and crowd dynamics under extreme phenomena, and from short-term traffic forecasting to travel behavioural research and the use of social media for efficient transport operations, the so‐called trend of big data has created a wide spectrum of challenges and opportunities in the field of transport research. Indicative areas of research could, for example, cover travel behaviour (by incorporating in modelling processes heterogeneous sources of information), logistics and consumer preferences, network capacity planning and optimisation (e.g. in the case of toll roads), risk management, response to extreme weather events or other emergency situations. Disaggregated data analysis by users' groups (e.g. age, gender) will contribute to better focus specific needs and trends. At the same time, the collection and possible exploitation of ""big data"" pose a number of questions both in methodological terms as well as in legal, institutional and social ones, which need to be addressed. The main challenge is therefore to investigate the implications of the utilisation of big data in the transport field.In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address the following aspects:―Identification of areas and contexts in which ICT investments and exploitation of data should be implemented. Examination of a series of different case studies and contexts throughout Europe, in order to provide useful information and suggestions on the prerequisites of successful big data implementation in the transport sector from a socio‐economic point of view.―Identification of methodological issues and the development of necessary tools in order to allow for effective data mining and data exploitation.―Analysis of the barriers and limitations of the transportation system to exploit big data opportunities. This point should address issues that range from technical to institutional. For example, many transportation agencies and authorities, transport industries, etc. may not consider profitable the investment in collecting and analysing big data, worrying also about the associated costs and risks of data collection and sharing.―Examine the institutional and governmental issues and barriers concerning the application of big data in transport providing policy recommendations towards ""data openness"" and sharing. Issues of legitimacy and public acceptance (e.g. privacy, data security, etc.) are important and should be adequately addressed.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Appropriate exploitation of big data can help policy makers at the EU, national and regional level, as well as relevant decision makers to take informed decisions. Better data can help transport authorities and industries to understand the behaviour of travellers and consumers, also in disaggregated groups (e.g. age and gender), provide targeted information and identify policy interventions.Work under this topic is therefore expected to contribute to evidence–based decision making by improving knowledge on methodological and exploitation issues taking also into account economic and technical considerations.It is also expected to contribute to an early identification of critical issues linked to privacy, data security, legal and institutional aspects. It may therefore facilitate the development of an appropriate legal framework for the collection and exploitation of big data in the area of transport.""","""theme"""
"""Transport is a rapidly developing and changing sector which faces problems to develop, attract and retain appropriate staff. As the overall trend is to increase automation, the sector will depend more and more on specialised equipment and products. Future jobs will therefore require new and advanced skills in engineering as well as in back office operations, but at the same time, the growing interdisciplinary elements of transport activities will also require transport professionals with developed skills in safety, security, logistics, IT, behavioural sciences, marketing and economics. As a consequence a new paradigm needs to be developed in training and education cross-fertilizing the disciplines and combining traditional training methods (e.g. face-to face classrooms, on the job training, etc.) with alternative methods and learning systems (such as web-based training, immersive virtual learning environments /IVLE, etc.) addressing the different needs of the various skill levels (from low skilled workers to high skilled managers/researchers) and incorporating lifelong learning aspects which seem particularly important for the low and middle-skills segments of the workforce.The specific challenge of this topic will be to identify and assess future requirements for skills and training tools/methods across transport modes and systems, in order to improve the potential of the workforce and improve the gender balance in the field of transport.Proposals should address all the following aspects:―Explore the impact of the deployment of new technologies new business models, growing internationalisation, increased intermodality and interdisciplinarity of transport activities on employment profiles and identify future requirements of skills and competences across all skill levels of the transport workforce.―Identify critically review (and benchmark) existing and/or innovative training and learning methods and tools with a view to address the needs of the workforce in transport modes and systems of a growing complexity.―Identify critical issues to be addressed and subjects to be taught in order to meet the future needs of transport across all skills levels; identify and/or propose specific curricula for training in particular for the mid-low skilled workers and those who need to upgrade their skills through lifelong learning.―Define the competences of trainers and design new profiles of teams devoted to facilitating the transfer of knowledge through innovative ideas/methods.Issues of gender and age are important and should be appropriately considered.Actions should take into account and coordinate with, where appropriate, with other EU and national initiatives in the field, such as those supported in the context of Erasmus+ and its sector skills alliances.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.As described in the specific challenge, the transport sectors will undergo significant changes over the next years with the gradual deployment of new technologies, increased intermodality and internationalisation. These changes will lead to new requirements for skills and competences of the workforce in practically all relevant sectors. Work under this topic is expected to provide the identification of these new requirements, a critical review and analysis of educational and training needs and methods thus contributing to the elaboration of new training curricula, tools and methods to be used for the development of a workforce capable of meeting the future needs of the sector across Europe.

"""Accessibility is a concept used in order to address both travel patterns, attitudes and needs of particular social groups – e.g. gender specific needs, unemployed persons, vulnerable to exclusion citizens such as elderly, children, disabled, etc., as well as the mobility needs and transport use characteristics of people living in different types of areas such as rural, remote or deprived urban areas. To obtain a more comprehensive view which will allow the elaboration of measures and transport systems that will improve inclusive mobility and equity, and support social innovation in this area, it is necessary to incorporate both approaches considering specific geographical factors as well as the mobility needs and capabilities of particular population groups.Rural areas, for example, are faced with continuous challenges linked to demographic, socio-economic and mobility factors such as: declining populations characterised by more pronounced ageing; income factors; reduced number of services and economic viability of public transport schemes; longer distances and different mobility needs related to public transport. Urban peripheral, suburban and deprived urban areas on the other hand are often characterised by population groups which face acute social, demographic and economic problems which impact on their mobility and on their ability to use available transport systems on equal terms.In this context, the main challenge of this topic is to examine whether organisational, technological (including extended use of ICT) and social innovations in public transport can lead to improved accessibility, inclusive mobility and equity in prioritised areas, by responding better to their specific needs and demographic/socio-economic characteristics.Proposals should address all the following aspects:―Analysis of the characteristics of prioritised areas in terms of spatial, demographic and socio-economic characteristics and identification of the factors that influence mobility and accessibility.―Exploring travel behaviour and social habits of the population in a disaggregated way and assessing travel demands in prioritised areas.―Addressing mobility needs of vulnerable to exclusion population groups such as: elderly, children, youth, disabled, people in poverty etc., as well as possible limitations to the use of new transport business models (e.g. IT illiteracy of elderly or low educated persons, pricing, etc.). Identification of gender-related specificities in each group is strongly recommended.―Critical assessment of existing innovative organisational and operational frameworks aimed at delivering new mobility solutions and their impact on inclusive mobility and equity.―Identification and/or development of new, efficient, inclusive, affordable and accessible mobility solutions and public transport models taking also advantage of IT applications (such as social media, app-oriented services, etc.).The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.As described in the specific challenge, certain geographic areas (such as rural, remote and deprived urban areas) as well as population groups (such as the elderly, disabled, in poverty, etc.) are faced with particular challenges regarding their mobility needs and capabilities, to which current public transport systems do not always respond adequately.Work under this topic is expected to contribute to:―The identification and critical assessment of sustainable and inclusive mobility options for European citizens in prioritised areas and improve accessibility offered by public transport systems.―The development of effective, efficient and affordable mobility solutions which respond to the specific needs of particular population groups such as the elderly, the young, the disabled, taking into consideration the gender aspect.―The elaboration of new business models for public transport, with the deployment of organisational, technological (such as IT and app-oriented services) and social innovations taking into account possible social and demographic barriers for their effective use.""","""theme"""
"""There are indications that transport may be entering a period of paradigm shifts due to the introduction of disruptive technologies but also due to changes in individual preferences, behaviours, lifestyles and the emergence of social innovation and new concepts which are likely to impact on the future transport models and management. Some of these changes are already present, as for example, the growing trend towards vehicle sharing practices in many European cities, while others may still be at their very early stages, as for example, changing values of travel time.Car sharing has been gradually developing over the past two decades while new business models and social innovation are likely to emerge in the forthcoming years fostered also by new IT applications (app-based services). This relatively short period of time has not allowed for a comprehensive and established assessment of its various impacts in social, economic and environmental terms. Estimates for its growth potential over the next decades vary considerably, so do estimates about the ""replacing capacity"" of car sharing. Similarly, its effects in reducing congestions, emissions and noise – especially in urban areas – as well as the impact on car manufacturing industries have not been sufficiently explored.Travel time savings is often the principal benefit of a transportation project and efforts to achieve faster travel have been long dominating decision making. The value of travel time has been perceived as a cost which includes costs to businesses of the time their employees and vehicles spend on travel, and costs to consumers of personal (unpaid) time spent on travel. However, as technology evolves (particularly ICT), people can use their time during travel for business or leisure thus ""reducing"" the cost of travel in economic terms and allowing other considerations (such as energy savings, pricing, environmental and social considerations) to affect their travel time preferences.Transport research is needed to explore at an early stage the dynamics of such changes and their impacts in socio-economic and environmental terms. The specific research challenges of this topic are to provide comprehensive analyses of these new preferences, behaviours and lifestyles, identify the main factors that influence them and assess their potential economic, social and environmental impact. In all aspects, issues of age and gender should be taken into consideration.In order to meet this challenge, proposals should address one of the two following parts:1. Shifting from car ownership to sharing. Proposals should:―Compare the existing trends and forecasts across the EU and identify the factors (economic/social/demographic/spatial/cultural aspects), that influence the varied implementation of such schemes in different countries/regions/cultures including the growing use of app-based services.―Compare and benchmark existing business models, social innovations and identify possible new ones.―Assess the implications of car sharing schemes for the European car industry (impact on foreseen sales of conventional and electric cars, other revenues, etc.).―Assess the potential impact on emissions, noise and congestion, especially in urban environments, as well as on safety of potential users.2. Changing value of travel time. Proposals should:―Analyse differences between various travel motivations (leisure, business) and the related travel time value and examine the extent to which the proliferation of ICT applications such as wifi connections (e.g. in trains, ships) tend to reduce the perceived cost of travel time for private and corporate travel. Gender disaggregated data collection and analysis could contribute to a more thorough analysis.―Identify possible areas where a shift away from the ""speed paradigm"" would be feasible and provide estimates of environmental, socio-economic and organisational implications.―Propose cost-benefit analyses of additional time savings in case of already advanced transport connections (e.g. need for faster high speed trains, for new sections of motorways in certain ""almost saturated"" areas, etc.) taking into account the possible new concepts of value of travel time and their environmental and socio-economic implications.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.As mentioned in the specific challenge the topic seeks to provide comprehensive analyses of the dynamics of new preferences, behaviours and lifestyles, to identify the main factors that influence them and to assess their potential economic, social and environmental impact. Work under this topic is expected to collect and provide up-to-date information on the present state of development of new business models and social innovations, a reliable assessment of their growth potential across different geographical cultural and economic environments and an assessment of their impact in areas of key policy interest, such as urban congestion, emission and noise reductions. In addition, it is expected to provide concrete assessments of their impacts on the European car industry (including electric vehicles) over the mid-long term.The collection of updated and reliable data on the car sharing market and its prospects as well as assessments on their social, economic and environmental impact will facilitate evidence-based policy making particularly with regard to urban congestion/emissions/re-organisation of urban transport. It will also contribute to a forward looking analysis of the prospects of the European car industry market.Work is also expected to contribute to the generation of new knowledge in a new and under-researched area which may lead in the short-medium term to different cost-benefit assessment methods of transport projects and in depth knowledge of users attitudes and choices with respect to travel time and in the longer term in possible energy savings and emission reductions as well as re-organisation of transport routes and schedules based on different perceptions of the value of travel time.""","""theme"""
"""To promote the interest of students and researchers on research and innovation in the transport sector, by rewarding the best innovative ideas and research achievements in this field.The action should focus on organising two competitions for transport research and innovation awards to be assigned at the TRA conference in 2018:―A competition for students and young researchers with the goal of stimulating the interest among young researchers/students in the field of transport.―A competition for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts based on results from EU-funded projects only.Both competitions should cover all transport modes and cross-cutting issues (technological, socio-economic and behavioural aspects) in line with the EU policy objectives for smart, green and integrated transport. The organisation of these awards should ensure high-quality competition and very good media coverage before, during and after the TRA conference.The action should give particular attention to gender issues.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.4 and 0.6 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Capture of CO2 from power plants or industrial processes and subsequent utilisation through (bio-) chemical transformation into high-volume added value products (CCU) can be an alternative to geological storage which could provide an important cost reduction to the entire CO2 sequestration process. CO2 utilisation has the potential to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions if the CO2 replaces manufactured CO2 or the resulting product provides long term abatement of the CO2, or if CO2 replaces fossil fuels as raw materials, depending on the amount of extra energy used in the process. In addition, the conversion of CO2 into fuels could provide opportunities for energy storage and for higher security of fuel supply.There are still relevant and significant scientific and technological challenges to be able to exploit the CO2 as a chemical and fuel feedstock in a systematic manner. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of such CO2 utilisation technologies to produce added value products at larger scale, in an operational environment to be able to assess the industrial, economic and environmental potential of such technologies. In the context of energy research, the focus will be on CO2 utilisation options that have the potential to yield a significant, net reduction of CO2 emissions in volumes sufficient to make a meaningful contribution to our climate change objectives. The use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery is out of scope of this topic. Projects should address the specific technology needs for capture and purification of CO2 emitted by the power or process industry to deliver the desired concentration and purity for the subsequent conversion process.

"""The increasing use of subsurface resources resulting from growing energy needs and the growing demand for water and raw materials represent key challenges, requiring a more integrated, efficient and sustainable use of these resources, and the minimisation of any negative health and environmental impacts. Synergies should be nurtured, while conflicts of use should be avoided. This creates at the same time significant opportunities in terms of growth and job creation in advanced technology sectors related to the optimal management and use of the resources. This topic addresses three specific challenges that are highly relevant to the sustainable use of the subsurface: Geo-energy, Groundwater and Raw Materials.With regards to Geo-energy, information is needed on:Information on the European subsurface must be available and accessible to society in order to enable the more efficient and sustainable use, more integrated management and spatial planning of the subsurface and the energy resources, groundwater and raw materials it contains. This requires setting up a Pan-European database of harmonised and scientifically robust digital information of the subsurface and its potential uses in the field of geo-energy. The use and implementation of the database should be clearly defined and based on common agreed principles.Groundwater resources and the subsurface in general are increasingly used for a wide range of applications and therefore under pressure. Groundwater resources are threatened by climate change, pollution and water abstraction. There is a clear need to assess the impact of these drivers on the groundwater resources, their inter-linkage with surface water resources and the groundwater dependent terrestrial and associated aquatic ecosystems including coastal waters; as well as the built environment and rural and urban land use. Modern technologies allow characterisation and visualisation of groundwater bodies; simulation of potential pathways and groundwater flow velocities; assessment of temporal and spatial trends in groundwater quality and quantity; and assessment of their impact on and interaction with surface waters. Such work both provides and requires information and knowledge of physical, chemical and hydraulic parameters on the European subsurface. These data must be available and easily accessible for all relevant end users to enable proper water resource management and integrated surface and subsurface spatial planning and assessments. The EU Raw Materials policy aims to ensure the sustainable supply of non-energy raw materials from the EU and global sources, including metallic and industrial minerals, as well as construction materials (dimension stones and aggregates).Supply from the EU sources requires harmonized and standardized EU level data and information on raw material deposits, as well as on mine-wastes materials - such as by-products, waste rocks, tailings and residues – that could be recycled and re-used. Discovery of new resources needs enhanced information and ore deposit models in exploration and resource assessment to focus increasingly on deeply buried deposits, as well as on mineral deposits on or below the sea-floor.Such EU level data and information do not exist at the moment. However, there is relevant knowledge of mineral deposits at the Member States level with heterogeneous terminology and reporting standards.There is also a need for European sustainable sub-surface planning and use that should be based on documentation and spatial databases of deposit and high-potential exploration areas.Proposals should pool the necessary resources from national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint transnational call for proposals with EU co-funding. The action is targeted at publically funded research performing organisations. Their participation must be mandated by the national/regional authorities in charge (normally the responsible Ministry). The co-funded call for proposals must be based on in-kind contributions from their institutional funding and the beneficiaries will carry out the transnational projects resulting from their call for proposals fully or partially themselves.GIS-based databases shall be developed with a view to, in the longer term, the operation and maintenance of an integrated database and map of the European underground, its resources (geo-energy, groundwater and raw materials) and its potential uses. Where appropriate, synergies and compatibility with the EPOS research infrastructure is required and will ensure that developed databases, tools and models can serve the largest communities. The database shall be INSPIRE compliant and be compatible with energy minerals data and marine maps (EMODnet) for the proper land planning and use of both surface and sub-surface. Furthermore, databases should have the technical specifications so that they can be potentially hosted by the European Commission.Geo-energy:In the field of geo-energy, the ERA-NET shall collate, interpret and produce reliable and impartial scientific information on geologically based energy resources and potential environmental and climate consequences related to their potential exploitation (e.g. hazards, risks, interference, synergies, conflicts of use), including conventional and unconventional[1] oil and gas, coal, coal bed methane (CBM), gas hydrates, geothermal resources and uranium, as well as CO2 storage and energy storage (note that certain resources are of local relevance only such as for example gas hydrates and uranium). This includes developing state-of-the-art methodologies and workflows focusing on efficient cross border and integrated pan-European resource mapping and assessment, both onshore and offshore. Specific site investigations are excluded from the ERA-NET scope.Deliverables should among others comprise online atlases of geo-energy related resources; their properties essential for assessing feasibility, performance and behaviour; maps and cross-sections of main structural elements and faults.In the field of groundwater, research should develop and enhance the knowledge and the predictive capacity needed to assess the impact of climate change and human activities on groundwater resources and dependent surface waters and ecosystems, and the consequences for groundwater quantitative and chemical status assessed according to the Water Framework and Groundwater directives. High quality models including estimated simulation and projection uncertainties are required tools for decision support systems that allow e.g.:The ERA-NET will contribute to:Deliverables shall include:The Raw Materials specific challenge shall address non-energy non-agricultural raw materials and minerals, and shall address all 28 EU Member States[2].The ERA-NET shall, through intelligence networking and coordination, enhance and maintain the pan-EU mineral deposits inventory/database, in line with and building on existing activities in the framework of the EIP on Raw Materials. It shall provide economic geology maps of construction materials and industrial and metallic minerals across the EU 28 Member States in a free publicly accessible Internet/web-portal form. The ERA-NET shall also deliver a pilot study identifying targets for general exploration, using innovative technologies and challenging a better understanding of ore genesis and direct exploration at deeper, unexploited levels of the Earth’s crust.Deliverables shall include:Improved interoperability of data and information, thus allowing a uniform, unbiased and independent insight in the distribution of identified and prospective geo-energy, groundwater and raw materials resources. Better understanding and management of the water-energy-raw materials nexus through a more integrated and efficient management and exploitation (and more responsible and publicly-accepted use) of subsurface resources for the various uses, while reducing any associated potential impacts and risks.This activity directly aimed at supporting public-public partnerships with Member States and Associated Countries, technology platforms with industrial partners and earth observation networks is excluded from the delegation to INEA and will be implemented by the Commission services.[1]The ERA-Net should take account of work done under the action Energy WP2014/2015 B.2.9- Energy Policy Support on Unconventional Oil and Gas (Administrative Arrangement JRC N °33565).

"""Carbon capture and storage (CCS), enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and unconventional gas development impact on the subsurface. Subsequently, advanced and cost effective monitoring of the containment of underground CO2 and natural gas is vital for the sustainable management of the subsurface and its resources.In CCS, the safe and permanent geological storage of CO2 requires a continuous and sophisticated monitoring of the storage complex. For enhanced geothermal systems, the use of supercritical CO2 has been proposed as a circulating heat transmission fluid. The CO2 would bring the advantage of a low viscosity and hence low flow resistance as compared to water, and could achieve permanent storage of CO2 as a supplementary benefit. In both CCS and EGS, robust monitoring is a key prerequisite for the safe and sustainable storage or circulation of significant volumes of CO2 in the subsurface.Technological progress, in particular the combination of horizontal drilling with multiple stages of hydraulic fracturing, has enabled the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources. This has resulted in new opportunities, but also bears environmental and public health risks, which need to be better understood, monitored, managed and communicated appropriately. These risks relate mainly to water pollution (in particular stemming from insufficient underground characterisation, inappropriate well casing, the use of chemicals in the fracking process, and waste management), but also air emissions as well as local impacts linked in particular to transport, land and water use.Research is needed to better understand and quantify possible (natural and engineered) leakage pathways for natural gas, the rates of leakage into aquifers and escape at surface, the impacts that leakage can have on fresh groundwater resources, soil and biodiversity, and the time frame in which emissions will return to baseline values. In addition, the effective detection and quantification of leakage requires a scientifically robust method for determining natural background concentrations of CO2 and natural gas in the soil and at the surface.Uniform, unbiased and independent data are needed to improve environmental stewardship in all three aforementioned geo-energy applications.The exact scope of this topic will be further specified in the course of 2016, taking account of, inter alia, the review of the effectiveness of the Commission Recommendation of 22 January 2014 on minimum principles for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons (2014/70/EU) (such as shale gas) using high-volume hydraulic fracturing, as well as preliminary findings from four projects on environmental impacts of unconventional gas funded under Horizon 2020 2014-2015 Work Programme.To be further specified in the course of 2016. This topic may provide European and North American researchers with a platform to enhance and deepen transatlantic dialogue on environmental and public health issues related to these three applications.""","""theme"""
"""The share of energy produced from renewable resources is growing rapidly. The output of wind and solar power is highly variable, and depends of factors such as weather conditions and time of day. With this growing share of renewable power, in particular when having priority access to the grid, fossil fuel power plants will have to increasingly shift their role from providing base-load power to providing fluctuating back-up power to meet unpredictable and short-noticed demand peaks, in order to control and stabilise the grid. Plants should be able to run both at the lowest part load possible at the highest possible efficiency. Moreover, plants will be required to operate across the entire load range with high load-change velocities, and even operate in start/stop mode with full turndown and very fast re-start, all at minimal (lifetime) fuel consumption. This forces base-load plants to operate through significantly more thermal cycles, leading to increased rate of wear on plant components. Operational flexibility therefore presents a significant challenge for fossil fuel power (and CHP) plants.Focus on progressing solutions that already reached TRL 3 to TRL 4-6 (please see part G of the General Annexes) and offer the highest potential for a deeper integration into an advanced energy system with ever higher shares of renewable energies, for both existing (retrofitting) and new thermal power plants. Solutions with lowest greenhouse gas emissions, residue disposal and water need per energy unit are preferred. Collaboration with power plant operators is strongly encouraged. Support will not be given to projects that provide performance improvements that are not related to load fluctuations.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 3 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Projects should lead to innovative and cost-effective solutions to improve the ability of new and/or existing dispatchable thermal power plants to meet fast load changes, in order to better support the grid due to fluctuations in energy peak demand and power output from renewable sources, at minimal fuel consumption and emissions, while mitigating the effects of cycling operation to avoid excessive wear and service life expenditure, and not impeding the potential CO2 capture readiness of the power plants.""","""theme"""
"""The application of CCS to industrial sectors other than power (e.g. steel, cement, refining) is expected to deliver half of the global emissions reduction from CCS by 2050. In the near future, these industrial applications will open up new opportunities and avenues for CCS that can accelerate its deployment. Also, Bio-CCS technologies have the potential of leading to CO2 negative emissions. Integrating CCS technology in the best possible way so as to optimise the use of energy in the capture process, minimise process efficiency losses, achieve a suitable CO2 purity for transport and storage, and maintain the quality of the industrial end product, is a particular challenge.Piloting under realistic conditions is required to significantly lower the energy penalty and capture costs. Projects must include activities to explore (possibly shared) local or regional transport and storage needs and solutions.Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 4-5 to TRL 7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).Environmentally benign and cost-effective technologies should be pursued.Collaboration with industrial end users is essential.In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation[1], international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with China.Knowledge sharing with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as early and sustained engagement and involvement of concerned communities through targeted information and dissemination activities, is essential.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 4 to 9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.The cost- and resource-effective application of CCS in industrial operations will expand the available options for CCS and provide a stepping stone to its wider deployment; the concomitant deployment of CCS both in fossil-fuel power production and in energy-intensive industries could facilitate clusters of CCS projects, thereby improving economies of scale for both CO2 transport and storage. CCS in energy intensive industry can help ensure a competitive position for existing EU industries in a future carbon-restrained world, thus reconciling competitiveness with EU climate goals.[1]COM(2012)497""","""theme"""
"""The EU is committed to an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050. Nonetheless, fossil fuels will continue to be used in Europe's power generation as well as in other industrial processes for decades to come. Therefore, the 2050 target can only be achieved if the emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the power generation sector and energy intensive industries are eliminated from the system. This will require the application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). A key challenge in the short-term for driving CCS to deployment is the development of geological storage. Projects should enable, under ""real life"" conditions, the development and demonstration of best practices for the entire storage cycle, from site characterisation to operation, including key components of CO2 transport infrastructure, monitoring and mitigation/remediation of leakage, and including education and training.Focus should be on progressing technologies that already reached TRL 4-5 to TRL 6 (please see part G of the General Annexes).Knowledge sharing with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as early and sustained engagement and involvement of concerned communities through targeted information and dissemination activities, is essential.In this particular context, new types of interactions between societal actors are encouraged. Projects should identify the key drivers and influencers of public attitude, identify distorted perceptions and develop sound arguments to address them.International cooperation is encouraged, in particular activities between EU project(s) under this topic and non-EU projects (e.g. from Australia and/or North-America).The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 9 to 16 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Demonstration of safe and environmentally sound CO2 storage will play a key role in optimising the safe operation of storage sites and in fine-tuning regulatory issues, in promoting confidence in CO2 storage and building public awareness of CCS.

"""The transition to a low-carbon energy system poses a unique set of policy, technological and scientific challenges, as it changes the fundamental nature of the interrelations between all actors in our societies (from energy incumbents to regulators and citizens). Not only there is a need to find novel approaches to the development and application of technological or social processes as they relate to the energy transition, but also to better understand the changes they bring to people’s behaviour, pervasive values, cultures of practice and modes of communication.Since researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) have a particular expertise in analysing and understanding deep change and in designing innovation processes, including social innovations, they must play a stronger role in addressing energy-related challenges. Accordingly, SSH aspects must be better integrated into all stages of the research process.At present, the energy-related SSH landscape is quite fragmented: there is a lack of exchange among different SSH communities, as well as between these communities and other energy-research disciplines.

In such cases, mobilising the necessary investment can only be achieved by pooling together financial resources from multiple countries, the Commission, and the private sector.

To cope with the exploding amount of data, the sequential analysis process (capture, store, analyse) is not sufficient; proposals should explore on-the-fly analysis methods offering reactivity, compute efficiency and availability. Graphical simulation interaction will require new real-time features; configuration and deployment tools will have to evolve to take into account the composability of software execution environments.c) Exascale I/O and storage in the presence of multiple tiers of data storage: proposals should address exascale I/O systems expected to have multiple tiers of data storage technologies, including non-volatile memory. Fine grain data access prioritisation of processes and applications sharing data in these tiers is one of the goals as well as prioritisation applied to file/object creates/deletes. Runtime layers should combine data replication with data layout transformations relevant for HPC, in order to meet the needs for improved performance and resiliency. It is also desirable for the I/O subsystem to adaptively provide optimal performance or reliability especially in the presence of millions of processes simultaneously doing I/O. It is critical that programming system interoperability and standardised APIs are achieved. On the fly data management supporting data processing, taking into account multi-tiered storage and involving real time in situ/in transit processing should be addressed.d) Supercomputing for Extreme Data and emerging HPC use modes: HPC architectures for real-time and in-situ data analytics are required to support the processing of large-scale and high velocity real-time data (e.g. sensor data, Internet of Things) together with large volumes of stored data (e.g. climate simulations, predictive models, etc.). The approaches should include support for real-time in-memory analysis of different data structures, direct processing of compressed data and appropriate benchmarking method for performance analysis. Interactive 3-D visualisation of large-scale data to allow users to explore large information spaces in 3-D and perform on-demand data analysis in real-time (e.g. large scale queries or analytics) should be addressed. Interactive supercomputing is required to execute complex workflows for urgent decision making in the field of critical clinical diagnostics, natural risks or spread of diseases; this implies adapting operational procedures of HPC infrastructures, developing efficient co-scheduling techniques or improving checkpoint/restart and extreme data managemente) Mathematics and algorithms for extreme scale HPC systems and applications working with extreme data: Specific issues are quantification of uncertainties and noise, multi-scale, multi-physics and extreme data. Mathematical methods, numerical analysis, algorithms and software engineering for extreme parallelism should be addressed. Novel and disruptive algorithmic strategies should be explored to minimize data movement as well as the number of communication and synchronization instances in extreme computing. Parallel-in-time methods may be investigated to boost parallelism of simulation codes across a wide range of application domains. Taking into account data-related uncertainties is essential for the acceptance of numerical simulation in decision making; a unified European VVUQ (Verification Validation and Uncertainty Quantification) package for Exascale computing should be provided by improving methodologies and solving problems limiting usability for very large computations on many-core configurations; access to the VVUQ techniques for the HPC community should be facilitated by providing software that is ready for deployment on supercomputers.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals should clearly indicate the subtopic which is their main focus. At least one project per subtopic will be funded.""","""theme"""
"""To develop a sustainable European exascale HPC Ecosystem.Proposals should address a single of the two following subtopics:a) Coordination of the Exascale HPC strategy and International Collaboration: Proposals must include activities for promoting a joint community structuring and synchronisation; the further development and update of the Strategic Research Agenda for High Performance Computing as well as the application and applied mathematics exascale roadmaps; prepare the ground for targeted international research collaboration on specific aspects of the exascale challenges. Proposed actions should also seek to create synergies with other HPC related activities under H2020, in particular concerning the underlying basic technologies that are required for exascale computing (e.g. LEIT/Advanced Computing, LEIT/Photonics, and ECSEL (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership)); and concerning the relevant research in applications, the progress of which critically relies on cutting-edge HPC systems (LEIT/Big-Data, LEIT/Cloud area as well as relevant research in applications emerging from the H2020 Societal Challenges in domains such as health (e.g. VPH initiative), genomics, climate change, energy, mobility and smart cities).b) Excellence in Exascale Computing Systems: The focus should be in boosting European HPC academic research excellence in future exascale-class computing cutting across all levels – hardware, architectures, programming, applications – and including specific actions to better structure the European academic HPC research, create stronger links with HPC providers and HPC users, attract venture capital, promote entrepreneurship and foster industry take-up.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""The challenge is to foster the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions. Compared to existing solutions, the roadblocks to overcome include i) the integration and further research and development where needed of the most advanced technologies across the value chain (components, devices, networks, middleware, service platforms, application functions) and their operation at large scale to respond to real needs of end-users (public authorities, citizens and business), based on underlying open technologies and architectures that may be reused across multiple use cases and enable interoperability across those; ii) the validation of user acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues of trust, attention, security and privacy through pre-defined privacy and security impact assessments, liability, coverage of user needs in the specific real-life scenarios of the pilot, iii) the validation of the related business models to guarantee the sustainability of the approach beyond the project.Pilots are targeted, goal driven initiatives that will propose IoT approaches to specific real-life industrial/societal challenges. Pilots are autonomous entities that involve stakeholders from supply side to demand side, and contain all the technological and innovation elements, the tasks related to the use, application and deployment as well as the development, testing and integration activities. Large scale validation is characterised by the fact that it will be possible to operate the functional entities implemented in the pilot under load and constraints conditions close to operational load one's, either with real traffic/request/processing loads, or with emulated loads where full implementation is not possible. Demonstration to operate the system across multiple sites, scalability to large amount of heterogeneous devices and systems, as well as with large amount of real users are expected. Pilot work plans should include feedback mechanisms to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological and business approach to the particular use case.Use of experimental testbeds, such as FIRE[1], and real-world demonstrations may support IoT technologies validation before they are deployed in field trials. Given the considerable amount of work carried out on M2M/IoT and Cyber Physical Systems architectures (e.g. IoT-A) open platforms (e.g. FIWARE, CRYSTAL, UniversAAL) and standards (e.g. oneM2M) over the last few years, pilots are encouraged to exploit this previous work where applicable with the objective of further demonstrating the generic applicability and interoperability of these and/or other architectures, platforms and standards, and to identify where standards are missing or should evolve, as well as needed pre-normative activities.IoT finds applicability in a broad range of industry, business and public services scenarios. On the basis of European relevance, technology readiness and socio-economic interest the following areas have been identified to be addressed with Large Scale IoT Pilots.Pilot 1: Smart living environments for ageing wellThe objective is to deploy innovative and user-led pilot projects capable of supporting and extending independent living at home for older adults based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The smart living environments should be based upon an integrated system of a range of IoT-based technologies and services with user-friendly configuration and management of connected technologies for homes and outside.They should provide seamless services and handle flexible connectivity while users are switching contexts and moving in their living environments. The proposed pilots should also demonstrate feasibility of integration with other relevant application domains such as energy, transport, or smart cities. The solutions shall build upon advanced IoT technologies, using and extending available open service platforms, standardised ontologies and open standardised APIs. Proposals shall address integration, standardisation and interoperability work on required ICT platforms, services and data sources, as well as on innovation in organisational and business models for service delivery.Proposed solutions should take into account the specific requirements for accessibility, usability, cost efficiency, personalisation and adaptation arising from this application sector. They should be based on active user engagement from the outset and should involve a multi-disciplinary approach in order to ensure the understanding of user needs and their evolution, safeguarding ethics and privacy and the assessment of impact. This should include quality of life for older adults and their carers, care system efficiency gains, business and financing models and organisational changes required for service delivery.A clear methodology for socio-economic impact assessment should be included. Large scale pilots should demonstrate the benefits of smart living environments based on IoT in terms of prolonged independent and safe living of older adults at home with good quality of life. The number of users involved and duration of pilot services should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis, with a minimum of 4 pilot sites in 4 countries.Pilot 2: Smart Farming and Food SecurityThe implementation of Precision Agriculture has become possible thanks to the development of sophisticated sensors, robots and sensor networks combined with procedures to link mapped variables to appropriate farming management actions. Those sensors, either wired or wireless, integrated into an IoT system gather all the individual data needed for monitoring, control and treatment on farms located in a particular region. Such future Internet of Things scenario would bring data management to a new level by establishing interactions between the concerned objects, help them exchange information in efficient ways and enable them to execute autonomously appropriate interventions in different agricultural sub-sectors (e. g. arable crops, livestock , vegetable and fruit production) and their associated post-production value chain through to the consumer. The introduction of the IoT scenario would allow monitoring and control of plant and animal products during the whole life cycle from farm to fork. It should thereby also help farmers' decision making with regard to the use of inputs and management processes. The challenge is to design architectures to “program” or track each object for optimal behaviour, according to its role in the Smart Farming system and in the overall food chain, decreasing use of water as well as other natural resources and inputs, lowering ecological footprints and economic costs as well as increasing food security. It also enables consumers to access trustworthy traceability information throughout the whole food chain.Proposals shall include an adequate combination of different farms to ensure that the deployment of the technology is adapted to the needs of different types and sizes of farms across Europe. Activities should allow for a wide geographic coverage within Europe and benefit both conventional and organic agro-food chains. In addition, proposals shall cover at least three sub-sectors (e.g.arable crops, livestock, vegetable and fruit production).Proposals should fall under the concept of multi-actor approach[2] and allow for adequate involvement of the farming sector in the proposed activities.Pilot 3: Wearables for smart ecosystems Demonstration of innovative wearable solutions and services integrated in interoperable IoT ecosystems. Wearables are integrating key technologies (e.g. nano-electronics, organic electronics, sensing, actuating, localization, communication, energy harvesting, low power computing, visualisation and embedded software) into intelligent systems to bring new functionalities into clothes, fabrics, patches, watches and other body-mounted devices. They assist humans in monitoring, situational awareness and decision making. Particular attention should be devoted to actuating functions providing whenever feasible fully automated closed-loop solutions. Prototype development and demonstration are expected for healthcare, well-being, safety, security and infotainment applications. Actions should be driven by concrete business cases, open design approaches and user requirements, taking into account data protection and liability concerns. They should involve the actors of the entire innovation value chain, potentially including creative and artistic actors, and aim at demonstrations in real world settings. The number of users involved should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis.Pilot 4: Reference zones in EU citiesBuilding on the past results and achievements[3] in some cities in Europe, a large scale pilot will cover a series of cities to operate as reference zones for showcasing and experimenting new citizen-centred IoT services. Starting from users' expressed preferences and needs, these cities will experiment and test similar new services and solutions, also through involvement of creativity hubs such as fablabs, co-working spaces, and gather experience at scale and evaluate citizens' acceptability and endorsement. It will enable SMEs to use open demonstrators to test innovative new services. This includes advanced solutions for traditional services' provisioning e.g. water management but also solutions that are at the edge of authorised business practices or regulation (ex: sharing of electricity, autonomous vehicles) and thus require dedicated testing zones. Whenever applicable, pilots will provide evidence of access to city areas where legal contexts are adapted to the demonstration requirements (i.e. 'reference zones'). Federation and interoperability between platforms may be considered as appropriate, as well as the ability to integrate data from different service providers. The number of users involved and duration of pilot services should be sufficient to ensure statistical significance in impact analysis, with a minimum of 4 pilot sites in 4 countries.Pilot 5: Autonomous vehicles in a connected environmentThe pilot addresses the added value and the potential of applying IoT for autonomous vehicles in a connected environment.It should test scenarios of deployment of safe and highly and fully autonomous vehicles (up to SAE[4] international level 5, full automation) in various representative use case scenarios, exploiting local and distributed information and intelligence. Core technologies include reliable and real-time platforms managing mixed criticality car services, advanced sensors and Internet information sources around which value-added apps may be constructed, efficient navigation and improved decision-making technology, interconnectivity between vehicles, vehicle to infrastructure communication. Using advanced technologies for connectivity is seen as an asset. The selected scenarios will provide proofs of concept showing how such technology provides benefits affecting users on a daily basis, for instance on the highways or in urban congested environment, either on dedicated lanes or mixing autonomous connected vehicles and legacy vehicles. To make a real step towards future large scale deployment and to demonstrate dependability, robustness and resilience of the technology over longer period of time and under a large variety of conditions, priority will be given to permanent installations and sustainable pilots rather than to temporary prototypes or demonstrators.These evolutions are expected to be supported by an open service platform which may have access to all in vehicle embedded information sources and to car surrounding information, in view of providing value-added apps e.g. intelligent maintenance. Key barriers to the deployment of such vehicles and ecosystems such as robustness of the perception, how to keep users of highly and fully automated vehicles sufficiently engaged and overall user acceptance are in scope, as well as economic, ethical, legal and regulatory issues.Specific Pilot considerations:Pilots Implementation:Pilots in the selected areas will clearly identify the supply and demand sides. The effort devoted to supply and demand should be balanced for each pilot.The supply side represents the technological part of the pilot and addresses all the ICT elements that constitute the proposed approach. This includes:The demand/user side of the pilot covers all the application and usage related elements. This includes:Pilot projects are expected to contribute to the consolidation and coherence work that will be implemented by the CSA supporting the activities defined under ""Horizontal Activities"" below. This requires that they contribute to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoperability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 30 million (pilot 2), up to EUR 20 million (pilot 1), up to EUR 15 million (pilots 3, 4) and up to EUR 20 million (pilot 5) would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one large pilot is supported for each area.Pilots are expected to have a high impact on citizens, both in the public and private spheres, industry, businesses and public services. Key performance indicators should be identified to measure progress on citizen benefits, economic growth, jobs creation, environment protection, productivity gains, etc.Pilots' impact should go beyond involved partners and will aim at influencing external communities by putting in place appropriate mechanisms.For Pilot 1:[1]Future Internet Research and Experimentation[2]The multi-actor approach aims at more demand-driven innovation through the genuine and sufficient involvement of various actors (end-users such as farmers/farmers' groups, fishers/fisher's groups, advisors, enterprises, etc. As a minimum, this material should feed into the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' for broad dissemination as 'practice abstracts' in the common EIP format for practitioners. Facilitation/mediation between the different types of actors and involvement of relevant interactive innovation groups operating in the EIP context, such as EIP Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes, are strongly recommended. For further information on the multi-actor approach concept please refer to the Introduction to SC2 Work Programme.[3]E.g. FIRE and FIWARE[4]Society of Automotive Engineers, J3016 standard[5]In line with Article 23 (7) of the Rules for Participation the amounts referred to in Article 137 of the Financial Regulation may be exceeded, and if this is the case proposals should explain why this is necessary to achieve the objectives of the action.[6]It is recommended to also use established networks reaching out to SMEs like the Enterprise Europe Network and the NCP network for calls publications and awareness raising towards SME's.""","""theme"""

"""Copernicus, the Union's Earth observation and monitoring programme entered into force in 2014 and produces a wealth of data and information regarding the Earth sub-systems (land, atmosphere, oceans) and cross-cutting processes (climate change, emergency and security). Copernicus data and information are mainly made available on a free open and full basis. This is expected to unleash unique market opportunities. It is important to foster market development exploiting the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web) across different market segments through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.For such applications and developments to succeed in the market, the product needs to be shaped according to users’ needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users’ workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development.Proposals may address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and its smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. To this aim, a business model, which includes the phase of the project following the end of the public funding, should be part of the proposal.The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product.

"""Effective access to Copernicus dedicated mission data and Copernicus service information by public and private users is a sine qua non condition for the achievement of Copernicus' objectives.In this context, Copernicus faces important challenges. First, the multiplicity of Copernicus partners involved in Copernicus dissemination activities requires both flexible and effective coordination. At the moment Copernicus dissemination infrastructure is built around different dissemination platforms operated by Member States (as in the collaborative ground segment), ESA, EUMETSAT, and service operators, which are in the process of being made interoperable. Second, the sheer volume of data and information to be disseminated and used, puts Copernicus at the forefront of the big data challenges. This new paradigm requires a change of approach to data curation and dissemination, in the form of a technological leap to both ingest processing and make available the increased volume of Copernicus data and information considering both temporal and spatial resolutions. As a reward, the Big Data paradigm offers new perspectives for data intensive activities where Europe could still close its technological gap with the US with huge industrial implication.The free, full and open data policy will support the development of a strong Earth observation downstream service industry if an effective and scalable dissemination system is implemented to meet the Big Data exploitation challenges and to address the full data cycle needs (e.g. standardised data query, retrieval, data exchange methods, processing). Therefore, Europe needs to foster a Copernicus dissemination infrastructure spurred by a vibrant European downstream sector taking advantage of the timely availability of the Copernicus data and information to provide innovative Earth observation information products on a worldwide basis based on European Internet platforms using advanced big data technologies and serving a worldwide market. Two main strands of activities are expected to be addressed: (i) the evolution of the Copernicus data infrastructure; and (ii) the adaptation of big data technologies to Copernicus user scenarios (i.e. data discovery and analytics to store and extract information).Proposals should take into account needs emerging from ongoing linked actions within Copernicus including the dissemination platform; access to data and the Collaborative Ground Segment. To that end an information document will be made available as part of the general call package.In particular:(i) the evolution of the Copernicus data infrastructure should foster innovative business models for data exploitation allowing for numerous new users. Projects should should propose scenarios for the platforms for EO data use processing and storage. This new paradigm requires a change of approach to data curation, processing, dissemination and the way data are used. Cross-fertilisation with other big data domains is needed to ensure that EO data exploitation can benefit other domains/sectors (and that tools are in place), and that lessons learnt in other sectors can be benefitted from. The latter includes for instance experiences in strategies for co-locating or distributing processing to different levels, dissemination of data and archiving including products for merging different sources e.g. data co-registration and fusion in temporal and spatial domains.(ii) Big Data, activities shall bridge the gap between Earth observation and information technology sectors taking into account the user needs for EO Big Data and aiming at developing innovative solutions. taking into account the needs of 1) non-expert users like policy makers involved in societal challenges, 2) experts involved, and 3) small and medium innovative enterprises. Activities shall be complementary to activities enabled by the ICT and research infrastructures work programmes which address generic challenges in the area of data mining, open linked data, web ontology, digital earth[1].Activities are expected to address any aspect of the data lifecycle which can solve EO big data challenges , in particular data management activities (e.g. collection, processing including online processing, quality control, documentation, dissemination, cataloguing, preservation, usage tracking, integration) and usage activities (e.g. discovery, reception, analysis, product generation, user feedback, tagging, knowledge extraction, decision making). Activities are also expected to extensively use flexible coverage and open processing standards.In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""European industrial competitiveness in Earth observation depends on the availability of demonstrated/validated systems and sub-systems for operational and advanced missions in the commercial and institutional domain, but also on the readiness in the emerging market for innovative missions relying on small and very small systems (constellation, formation flying and fractionated instruments).The specific challenge, for the mid-term is to bring the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) forward for a number of Earth observation technologies and to ensure the readiness of European solutions to propose and support new mission concepts taking advantage of nano-, micro- and mini-satellites.In recent years small satellites have become more attractive due to lower development costs and shorter lead times.

"""Satellite missions with higher productivity add growing data requirements on missions. As a result high speed data handling, processing and transfer are required. These growing requirements are shared among a variety of applications, with a main focus on Earth observation and Telecommunication systems, and with applications also in Science and Exploration. Data challenges have to be addressed within the data chain on-board the satellites (e.g. processing, storage, compression, optimisation) and between the satellite and other terminals that can be located on ground or air-borne platforms, and also on-board other satellites. In particular, next generation Earth observation sensors pose the most challenging requirements for data links (in the Gbps range), including links from orbit to ground and inter-satellite communications (LEO to ground or GEO to ground), and including technology transfer related to very small LEO satellites (nano and cubesats), as well as direct ground link to very small LEO satellites (nanosat and below, including cubesats) considering optical technologies.Faster processing, larger storage, and high bandwidth transmissions to users will be needed. Moreover, smart on-board data compression and optimisation will become a growing necessity. All these improvements will be required to efficiently support the next generation of data intensive missions. To support this future scenario, innovations must be brought to the payload data management system (including data optimisation processes), to inter-satellite links, to satellite-ground communication, and to the ground segment data handling system.Moreover, within the context of preparatory work for the next generation of the Copernicus space component, mission concepts will be developed by European industry based on mature Earth observation technologies and solutions.Activities shall aim at providing advanced on-board data handling and transfer for Earth observation and Telecommunication systems.

"""As a consequence of economic development, construction and demolition waste (CDW) has become a serious problem, creating serious environmental pollution in certain areas of the world. In the EU, CDW accounts for approximately 25% - 30% of all waste generated and consists of numerous materials, many of which can be recycled.Advanced research actions and technical solutions are required for large-scale reuse and recycling of construction materials in building refurbishment, contributing to overall CO2 and energy reduction. At the same time pre-fabricated components are now commonly used in the construction sector not just to reduce costs but also to facilitate installation/dismantling and re-use of components.The development of pre-fabricated elements containing a high share of recycled materials and of energy-efficient building concepts considering a high fraction of material replacement is needed. The main focus would be on the recovery/ recycling of materials that have the highest technical and economic interest and which are associated to refurbishment or demolition processes.At the same time, the possibility to reuse different materials in energy-efficient buildings should be further investigated through a proper characterisation of their properties. Also the development of processes for easy disassembly needs to be considered as well as the need to address strict regulations and standards (eg. anti-seismic) in several European regions.The EC Waste Directive mentions under Art 11- 2b that: ""by 2020, the preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the list of waste shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by weight.""Energy-efficient building concepts using new or adapted prefabricated components need to be developed, in order to implement construction processes allowing the reuse and recycling of different materials and structures while reducing energy use and minimising environmental impacts.In the case of building retrofitting with traditional construction methods poor results are frequently obtained. Recent developments show that even with new constructions the use of recycled materials is still a challenge when prefabrication is concerned. There is a need to address material flows (on-site and off-site processes) and harmonize the way to acquire and use all the information related to the building and its stakeholders (procurers, builders, owners, users, operators, etc.) in order to radically modify the construction processes (e.g. lean construction and higher degree of industrial building prefabrication), and the off-site production of components (e.g. prefabricated components).Proposals should cover the following areas:The project should also address the demonstration of the recycling technologies in the construction or refurbishment of energy-efficient buildings representative of at least two different climatic zones across Europe, allowing for a high replication potential.Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.

"""The most important benefit associated with the refurbishment of an existing building comes from improving the energy performance, which gives an essential contribution to reach the EU 2020 consumption goals, taking into account that buildings represent 40% of the energy use in the EU. A key challenge for its large-scale implementation is the necessity to manage a broader involvement of stakeholders representing different interests and different responsibilities influencing the potential solutions and actions. This regards not only the choice of technologies, but also the design and renovation methods, as well as a number of socio-economic issues.Nowadays, decentralised energy generation technologies have been demonstrated in a number of building applications in Europe and beyond but large scale uptake and business deployment of these technologies is still in its early stage.

"""A major difficulty for civil protection actors to take proper, coordinated decisions for efficient actions (in relation with prevention, preparedness, surveillance, and in particular: response in times of crisis) results from insufficient situational awareness. This is even truer in the context of the EU Civil Protection mechanism[1]: reinforced cooperation across borders calls for improved cross-border situational awareness.Technologies close to maturity and prototype tools exist, including some issued from previous FP7 R&D projects, that gather or provide data and information from a wide variety of sources useful to improve situational awareness in time of crisis. But no system that satisfactorily integrates these technologies and tools, and fuses these data and information, is available yet. Additionally, there is a theoretical framework which should be focused to understand the psychological, cultural, language and societal dimension of situational awareness in order to prevent, prepare and manage crisis situations.Situational awareness systems for EU, national, regional and local buyers should be cost effective and interoperable, integrate different technologies (sensors; sub-systems for surveillance, manned and unmanned systems, early warning systems, communication systems, satellite-based systems), result from public-private cooperation, and demonstrate resilience and relative self-sufficiency.Situational awareness systems need to be customizable by specific civil protection authorities, and adaptable to various risks and crisis scenarios (for instance: climate-related hazards, industrial accidents, earthquakes, biohazards, space weather events, etc.), especially in the context of cross-border cooperation. Where needed, the involvement of other first-responders should be sought (i.e. water management authorities for flooding situations), in order to ensure full interoperability of systems.The action will identify new and promising solutions, develop and agree on the core set of specifications of a specific system, on the roadmap for research still needed for its development, and the related tender documents upon which to base future (research services and system) procurements.The EU may contribute to subsequent actions (PCP, PPI, other types of funding, …) aiming at implementing tender procedures to develop, test and validate prototypes of such a system.In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[2] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission.

"""Recent incidents in Europe and worldwide recalled that biological toxins can be produced by laypersons or acquired illegally and intentionally released in a criminal act to harm people. While different technologies are available for toxin detection and analysis, recent findings have shown that the comparability of analytical results from different laboratories is poor, which cast severe doubts about the validation of current methods and about the overall validity of analytical data. This means that in case of a bioterrorist act using compounds such as e.g. ricin (or others such as abrin), saxitoxin, botulinum, neurotoxins, enterotoxins, etc. there is no guarantee that decisions to react are made based on data meeting basic quality requirements. The lack of quality assurance/quality control tools (e.g. certified reference materials of ricin, botulinum, etc.) and standard operating procedures hampers the validation and the EU-wide comparability of biological toxin measurement data. There is therefore a need to develop an EU-wide approach for enhancing validating analytical capacities for biological toxin measurements in case of bioterrorism threats, similarly to what exists regarding chemical threats.The large variability among families of biological toxins complicates their measurement and unambiguous identification in human specimens, and environmental or food samples. Toxins are rapidly metabolised and degraded after incorporation, limiting the time window for successful identification and forensic analysis. Proposals should develop quality control tools, as well as the Standard Operating Procedures necessary for establishing a mechanism to systematically validate laboratory-based measurement techniques, including sample preparation strategies and analyses made in-situ issued by mobile and quickly deployable laboratories, which should be proposed for adoption at EU level.Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately.

"""Radicalisation leading to violent acts can have a huge impact on the society and its citizens: politically (seeding division between communities), economically, emotionally, and in terms of security. The roots of radicalisation are not well-known, whilst well-targeted response to emerging challenges of violent extremism cannot be developed without a full understanding of what drives the process of radicalisation and of how individuals may react to countermeasures. Also, terrorist groups and extremists are capitalising on advances in technology to spread propaganda and radical behaviours, but traditional law enforcement techniques are insufficient to deal with these new, evolving trends in radicalisation. The key in democratic societies is to ensure citizens’ rights to free thought – even radical thought – while protecting society from the fallout of illegal actions from violent radicalised groups and individuals.Terrorism in Europe now finds its inspiration in a larger variety of ideologies, as described in the 2013 Europol TE-Sat report: nationalist, anarchist, separatist, violent left-wing or right-wing ideologies, or Al Qaida- or Daesh-inspired ideologies.Preventing and countering radicalisation must engage the whole of society, and requires a holistic treatment, and a multidisciplinary approach.Factors constituting a violent radicalisation process can be many: familial, social, gender-based, socio-economical, psychological, religious, ideological, historical, cultural, political, propaganda-, social media- or internet-based. Events and conditions leading a person from ideas to violent action are also numerous, and mechanisms so complex that they need to be broken down to be understood.Radicalised individuals, including recent converts, Europeans or foreigners, get organized in various ways: centralised and hierarchical organisations; networks; smaller groups based in Europe or on foreign territories; cells; and lone actors operating in a more unconstrained and unpredictable way. It is important to understand how networks and groups act towards the violent radicalisation of individuals.Further to the recommendations of the Radicalisation Awareness Network, and to the work undertaken in the ongoing FP7 and other projects in the area, a better understanding of the causes and processes may lead to innovative, ethical solutions to counter violent actions taken by radicalized male or female individuals (policies for preventing violent extremism; counter-communication disseminated either online (YouTube, special forums, Twitter etc.) or offline (in the classroom or in one-to-one interventions for example), since preventing violent radicalisation is also about winning the hearts and minds and countering extremist propaganda; surveillance, investigation, and protection techniques; forensic tools), whilst preserving the fundamentals rights of the citizens.While Societal Challenge 6 mainly focuses on studying the phenomenon of radicalization, in order to provide input to the successive policy-making, proposals under this topic should focus on developing policy recommendations and practical solutions to be implemented by security end-users.In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, and in particular with international research partners involved in ongoing discussions and workshops, with the European Commission.

This can be achieved if forensic laboratories from a broad variety of EU countries with diverse legal systems agree on common technical standards and join forces along the following steps:Phase 0: To prepare an inventory of forensic technologies already available at TRL 4 or 5, and to identify, within all areas covered by the various ENFSI working groups (http://www.enfsi.eu/), a subset of technologies to be brought at TRL 8;Phase 1: To prepare the tenders packages for calls for tenders to build prototypes of a toolkit integrating the above-mentioned subset of technologies, that can be used across Europe; To develop EU-wide benchmarks and validation methods for forensic technologies;Phase 2: To implement the calls for tenders to generate 2 prototype toolkits from 2 different sources;Phase 3: To benchmark and validate the 2 toolkits against the methods developed during Phase 1;Phase 4: To draft a curriculum for pan European training in forensic technologies, and to plan for its assessment across Europe; to initiate the EU-wide certification of the toolkits based on the results of Phase 3.For grants awarded under this topic SEC-09-FCT-2017, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming to ensure exploitation of its results:To ensure that the outcome of the PCP action becomes also available to EU Member State national authorities as well as EU agencies not participating in the PCP for further procurement purposes, the proposal must necessarily state:(1). Agreement from participating procurement authorities to negotiate, in good faith and on a case-by-case basis, with non-participating procurement authorities that wish to procure a capability or a product fully or partly derived from the PCP action, the use of the information required to run such a procurement process, and solely for that purpose.(2).

"""Research undertaken in recent years has proposed innovative approaches for the detection of precursors of explosives, drugs, and more generally speaking substances threatening the security of the citizens. Such approaches often require the installation of networks of sensors throughout urban areas. Utility networks, which are well developed in such areas, could be both sources of information through the analysis of the substance that they transport/provide (e.g. energy consumption, characteristics of used waters) or of their environment (e.g. quality of air, etc.). They can constitute networked (mobile) platforms for sensors, but this potential remains largely untapped.Proposals should address the deployment of detection systems in large and medium cities, in existing networks, or a combination of such networks, for instance for the detection of explosive precursors and illegal chemicals (drugs). Proposals shall address sewage networks and quality of air monitoring networks, and may address other networks. The experiment should last a significant period of time (at least two years).Proposals should also provide for a mobile platform equipped to ascertain the composition and location of suspicious measurements, once data have been provided by the networked detection systems.Proposals should provide for the prototype of a system controlling the detection systems and capable of fusing data provided by a variety of such networks, and of interfacing with other networks, pay particular attention to ethical issues raised when using such systems, and address the sustainability of such systems.Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes.

"""Border management in European Union context means first and foremost the enforcement of the common policies and implementation of the common rules. As international travel flows continue to rise, there is growing pressure to process large volumes of people at border crossing points without delays. At the same time, the smuggling of people across the borders is growing. However, the external land borders of the European Union (and border crossing points) present a wide range of challenges, ranging from those relevant to Nordic Countries, to those in the Mediterranean.The European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) is establishing a mechanism for Member States' authorities carrying out activities at the European Union external border to share operational and situational information and pictures. But without investments in technology and information systems, it is simply not feasible to manage borders and border crossing points. Whilst technology offers great potential to meet the dual objective of enhancing border security while facilitating cross-border travel, its costs are often prohibitive, especially in the light of the current national budgets. Furthermore, the broad variety of heterogeneous IT applications and systems deployed for land border security makes their management increasingly complex and costly. Innovative, cost-efficient technologies are needed, or existing ones need to become more affordable, to meet border authorities and practitioners’ requirements, and budgetary constraints.The cost of a broad variety of technologies could be made more affordable, in priority those used at border crossing points bearing the heaviest burden (based on the analysis of flows of people and of smuggling methods, associated risks, and bottlenecks in surveillance and/or control.)The relevant border authorities are in the best position to identify the most relevant portions of the EU land borders that could benefit from more cost-effective solutions.Cost reduction may result from: merging several advanced technologies into novel border security solutions; trade-off against performance; optimizing the use of technologies where they are most effective at mitigating risks further to specific risk analysis; achieving greater interoperability among systems; enabling the early provision of data in advance to the time of crossing.The availability or scarcity of human resources and of space, the need for portable and versatile solutions are other parameters to be taken into account when considering the added value and cost of novel technologies solutions, including in terms of societal and ethical value and cost. In particular, the design of more homogeneous IT platforms, sharing an interface common to all operational databases and border security applications, is desirable to make their management less resource intensive.Overlap with the work being undertaken by border surveillance authorities in the context of the EWISA project[1] should be avoided, whilst compatibility with previous results from FP7 or H2020 projects is encouraged.Whereas activities will have an exclusive focus on civil applications, coordination with the activities of the European Defence Agency (EDA) may be considered with possible synergies being established with projects funded by the EDA programmes.

"""The concept of 'borders' has changed in recent times. The purpose and function of borders have been, and remain, to delineate and demarcate one sovereignty from another. However, borders must also allow for the smooth movement of people and goods.Maintaining the current level of checks is becoming increasingly expensive given the ever growing volumes of people and goods on the move, and increasingly more disruptive of flows. It would remain sustainable if thorough checks could be limited to fewer individual goods and people pre-selected further to a preliminary (and non-disruptive) risk-based screening of the flows.Proposals should take account of the four-tier access control model developed in the EU: measures undertaken in, or jointly with third countries or service providers (e.g. those managing Advance Passenger Information or Passenger Name Record systems); cooperation with neighbouring countries; border control and counter-smuggling measures; control measures within the area of free movement in order to prevent illegal immigration and cross-border crime inside the Schengen area.Innovative, international alert systems can be developed further to more co-operative law enforcement and investigative efforts. Building upon lessons learned and field experience is essential.The combination of a variety of arrays of sensors, new operational methods, and improved data management techniques can support appropriate law enforcement responses and enable better, transnational, interagency access to reliable and secure situational intelligence and information, on a real-time and cost-effective basis.Collaboration with IATA, the air transport industry and other partners and international stakeholders in other fields of transport safety (e.g. maritime, rail) may lead to the development of new solutions.Particular attention should be paid to personal data protection and to other ethical concerns that may arise from the development of risk-based screening at borders.The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 8million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately.

"""Member States' authorities are carrying out activities all along the European border, and have started to share operational and situational information. But several regions at the borders of the European Union are covered with forests, and face extreme temperature conditions. Detecting, locating, tracking or identifying persons and vehicles crossing the border in forested regions is extremely difficult given that technologies for surveillance through harsh unstructured environments are currently not effective. The increasing risk of irregular flows and immigration across the border with, for instance, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia or Brazil makes the issue even more acute than in the past.Systems should be developed that combine or improve surveillance technologies and techniques and arrays of sensors of different sorts capable to provide higher quality detection capabilities and imaging via the integration of different techniques, to achieve wide- and small-area through foliage detection, despite the canopy density, in a real operational context. They could build on airborne, satellite-based, and/or on ground based platforms.Solutions should be tested and validated in terms of capabilities to control effectively the land border covered by a vegetation layer, in all weather conditions.Pre-competitive research may be needed to address various stages of development, from sensor design, to the analysis and design of system configuration and to the integration and validation by (public) authorities for target detection, identification and recognition.Overlap with the work being undertaken by border surveillance authorities in the context of the EWISA[1] project should be avoided, whilst compatibility with previous results from FP7 or H2020 projects is encouraged.

"""Effective management of risks in the international supply chain is crucial to ensuring the security (and safety) of EU residents, the protection of the financial and economic interests of the EU, while at the same time facilitating legitimate trade. The ""EU Strategy and Action Plan for customs risk management"" (COM (2014) 527 final) Communication of the Commission drafts a strategy and an action plan for improving customs risk management and supply chain security. It identifies the need for customs and other competent authorities to acquire quality data on supply chain movements, to exploit them for risk assessment purposes, and to consequently adapt organizations and strategies for checks to make more efficient.Risk management of the movement of goods through the international supply chain requires identifying, evaluating and analysing the full range of largely diverse threats and risks associated with goods and their movements, at the EU, national, and intercontinental levels. It starts with the identification, by the custom authorities themselves, of the most serious risks, so that necessary controls are carried out at the most appropriate time and place.Strategies and tools are needed for the timely submission to customs authorities of relevant high-quality and comprehensive data on goods moving and crossing borders, whilst taking into consideration the national and EU legal, procedural and IT systems where they exist. Realistic methodologies and organisations need to develop, that facilitate collaboration among the relevant authorities (not only customs but also law enforcement, transport, security and border control agencies). Data governance policies and mechanisms for data sharing need to be agreed internationally.Common repositories that take advantage of existing instruments such as the Advance Cargo Information System (advance electronic notification of cargo coming into EU before it leaves the third country) which are under-utilised and under-exploited for risk management purpose, can support the intelligent use and management of complex and large amount of data, exploiting unstructured data, supporting operational and situational awareness of customs authorities, adding intelligence (trends analysis, correlation analysis, etc.) by means of state-of-the-art technologies including in the fields of Big Data, Data Analytics, Data mining, Visualization, Intelligent User's Interfaces, Insight knowledge and knowledge representation, artificial intelligence, automatic language translation.

"""For the traveller it would be ideal to cross borders without being slowed down. It is indeed likely that, in the next 10 years or so, technologies make it possible to implement ""no gate crossing point solutions"" that allow for seamless crossing of borders and security checks for the vast majority of travellers who meet the conditions of entry, and make sure that those who do not fulfil such conditions are refused entry.There is a broad variety of technologies and systems including information systems and (networks of) sensors that will become available to support border checks based on risk-assessment methods. Some are to be deployed in the vicinity of border crossing points, others can be mobile and used to check travellers data along his/her journey.However, in the intensive use of technologies that this will require bears the risk to invading people’s privacy, and the societal and political acceptance of technologies for “no gate solutions” is required prior to their implementation.The assessment of the acceptability of such (combinations of) technologies and systems by citizens (who need to remain in control of personal data) and practitioners is needed, that takes account of human behaviour, gender, legal frameworks, societal issues, and possible risk of discrimination.Methods developed to perform such assessments need also to generate information useful for decision makers to take informed decisions about future technology deployments, and for industry to design products that preserve privacy.Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of € 3million would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately.

Relevant national and FP7 research programmes and projects in the Biotechnology area have significantly contributed to improve European economic and environmental protection. Innovation in biotechnology also provides opportunities to transform the global economy from an extensive dependence on fossil raw material to a sustainable “bio-economy”.However, economic indicators suggest a need for urgent action to maintain Europe’s global lead in biotechnology. In order to increase the competitiveness of EU industries, broader and deeper collaboration across relevant sectors and Member States is necessary. It will also be necessary to better use research advances in areas such as systems and synthetic biology for applications and demonstration in industrial biotechnology.Proposals should gather a critical number of relevant programme managers and funders in the field, and implement a joint transnational call for proposals (resulting in grants to third parties) with EU co-funding, focusing on Technology Readiness Levels in the range of 3 to 6. They should build on the previous success of ERA-IB-2, ERASysAPP, ERASynBio under FP7, allowing for the seamless integration of the areas covered, together with the bioinformatics area and be complementary to related health initiatives.

Systems biology relies on cutting-edge technologies, including those in the fields of ""omics"" (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) and bioinformatics, all offering massive amounts of data, most of which remain stored and underexploited.

"""Nowadays CO2 re-use is one of several technological ways to reduce otherwise harmful CO2 emissions, thus making CO2 a valuable commodity rather than a pollutant. However, the research behind full development of CO2 reuse technologies is in its early stages. Some of these technologies use CO2 as a feedstock for chemicals and plastics, thus increasing the industrial biotechnology potential for enhancing European economic competitiveness. In this way, tackling the CO2 challenge includes interesting possibilities for encouraging innovation and sustainability.An industrial biotechnology route for CO2 re-use is fermentation, where CO2 is fermented into a desired molecule using hydrogen as a source of energy. However, there are technical issues that need to be resolved, because the biochemical reactions involved are not yet self-supporting in terms of energy for the industrial scale conversion of CO2 into chemicals. Moreover, the final yield of the products is low and the process needs optimisation. Ultimately, the success of CO2 reuse technologies will depend on developing processes which are less energy and material intensive than the processes they aim to replace and which can be scaled to an industrial level of production. In this context, an important consideration or advantage would be the ability of the microbes to process raw CO2 (low concentrations, presence of impurities, etc.).

Molecular farming represents a development opportunity for a set of new high-value crops, for the health, chemical and agricultural industries and their related technology sectors. However, the expansion of molecular farming has been dawdling, due to its reliance on standard genetic modification and the hurdles it poses for commercialisation.In the past ten years, complementary and more sophisticated new plant breeding techniques (NPBT) have been developed to produce new plants with the desired traits circumventing the main drawbacks of standard genetic modification (i.e. no foreign DNA is contained in the resulting end product).

"""In many currently explored applications of organic-inorganic hybrid materials, the achievement of superior properties is often hampered by the weak chemical (i.e. van der Waals, hydrogen bonding) interactions existing between the inorganic building blocks, leading, inter alia, to leaching of the inorganic components, agglomeration, phase separation, low mechanical stability. This is particularly critical for heterogeneous catalysis applications, where a robust linkage between the components would afford better performances in terms of recovery and re-use of the catalyst. A further factor affecting the actual effectiveness of heterogeneous catalysts is the accessibility of the active component, being facilitated by either i) a porous microstructure or by ii) a loosely cross-linked structure enabling swelling of the hybrid catalyst in the reaction medium, where the substrate is dispersed. In the latter case, an important role is played by the polarity of the medium in which the catalysis is carried out.Explore novel concepts in hybrid materials design for heterogeneous catalysis, e.g. based on templating-effects, hierarchical architectures, tailored heterostructures or surface functionalisation and based on one-step synthesis, accomplishing i) the formation of a robust structure based on covalent bonds between organic and inorganic components and ii) accessibility of the catalysis-active moiety by tailoring the morphology and the polarity of the resulting materials, according to the targeted conditions and application such as condensations and asymmetric reactions.A further aspect to be taken into account is the possibility to tune the cross-linking degree of the obtained hybrid materials by changing the synthetic parameters and synthesis route, to achieve different nano- and microstructures.

Research in the areas of biomimetic bio-inspired engineering and nanomaterials can provide several examples of the development of smart materials and has seen a significant expansion. Examples include materials that can alter their physical properties, (e.g. viscosity, shape, colour and more) in response to temperature, stress, electrical or magnetic fields, convert sunlight into electricity, store energy, etc. Smart materials have also been used extensively in sensor developments in aerospace and automotive applications with the aim of producing intelligent structures and components that provide information of their in-service conditions However, there are several concepts that have not yet been implemented in industrial scale. Such technologies include self-repair or self-healing materials, materials for vibration suppression, lightweight composites that can inform the user of any internal damage without the need of time consuming and expensive Non-destructive Examination (NDE), materials or structures that can undergo shape change either passively or by activation, Functionally Graded composite Materials (FGMs), energy storing components, etc. There is a need for predictive modelling of materials functionalities for those materials for which there are currently no accurate commercial or open-source codes available.Proposals are sought to address specific industrial needs and facilitate the implementation of smart materials for applications in transport, consumer goods and ICT. The potential extension of these applications to other industrial sectors such as e.g. oil & gas and petrochemicals will be an asset. The technical challenges to be addressed relate to the development, processing and integration of smart materials with new functionalities, as e.g. for: advanced sensors (nanosensor technologies), damage detection, self-repair, self-actuation, self-sensing morphing, magnetic functionality (for non-magnetic materials), optical functionality, sound and vibration damping, thermal management in ICT applications. Material concepts based on bio-inspired solutions can also be considered. Modelling of the properties of relevance to manufacturing should be considered and further developed. Although the materials most suited to such development are lightweight advanced composites from different material classes, (like multiferroics, polymeric, ceramic, glass or metal matrix composites, organic fibrous materials). It is expected that such smart materials may make use of the unique properties possessed by nanoparticles and therefore the development of nanomaterial based intelligent components will be within the scope of the call. The development of such material structures has to be accompanied by high resolution analytical tools that are able to simulate and characterise the materials on all scales and, moreover, to track and reveal their function –structure relations in situ.

"""Durability is a key criterion for materials in many applications and environments. Longer performing materials can strongly reduce overall life time costs, such as lower usage costs through reduced maintenance and shorter service interruptions. Costs may also be reduced in the production phase (raw materials, energy, transport, formability), in the installation phase, and the materials may be more appropriate for end of life reuse/recycling. Typical applications requiring excellent long term durability and high reliability are buildings, marine applications and infrastructures including off shore.

"""As material systems and device structures become nanosized and nanostructured, significant challenges exist with respect to their design and the tailoring of their functions in a controlled way. The use of discrete materials models, as a bridge for linking and coupling nanostructure features to macroscopic device functionality is gaining increasing importance in the fast and reliable development of new materials, devices, and the control of the related production processes. Characterisation techniques and experimental data for process optimisation and model validation are key in such developments.Europe has a large number of first-class laboratories for characterisation in the field of advanced materials and nanotechnologies. In some cases, regional hubs of laboratories addressing characterisation for specific industrial or application sectors have already been successfully established. Nevertheless, there is an ever increasing need for a strong transnational and trans-sectorial coordination and optimisation of existing characterisation technologies and their utilisation for the benefit of widespread process optimisation and model validation. This includes the need for widely agreed experiment protocols, multi-technique and multi-scale characterisation approaches, metadata descriptions of interpretation tools and accessible, relevant, and reliable data bases for raw and interpreted data.In the triangle of manufacturing, modelling, and experimentation, the projects should develop an open innovation environment for the optimisation of materials, materials behaviour and/or nano-device manufacturing processes, and for the validation of materials models[1] based on experimental characterisation.An open innovation environment should be created linking characterisation laboratories with capacities adapted to process optimisation and model validation needs. Also information on characterisation tools and expertise should be included.Commonly agreed validation and measurement protocols should be developed which address the most relevant issues related to experiments, process optimisation and model validation. Projects should also document their protocols for the interpretation of raw experimental data and document reliable models for data interpretation where needed. The project may seek to agree standards for interpretation protocols. Meta data to describe all protocols should be agreed.The same metadata should be used for interfacing existing characterisation databases to make search and linking between different, distributed databases effective and easy. The metadata should allow future extension to other sectors. Strategies and test rules pertaining to data integrity and quality mechanisms should be established. A concept to make raw and interpreted data citable should be developed and implemented for this system. The project should ensure wide spread participation.Projects should bring together a representative number of players from public and industrial nanoscale characterisation laboratories, from manufacturers, and from the academic and industrial materials modelling communities. To ensure a wide coverage, these players should cover several industrial or application sectors. Existing regional/national hubs may also participate, but they need to connect in the project to players in other countries, possibly also other regional/national hubs.The proposal should present a credible business plan for the maintenance of the open environment after the project duration.Proposers are strongly encouraged to consult the stakeholders outside the consortium through existing groups such as the European Materials Modelling Council or the Characterisation cluster. Appropriate resources should be foreseen for clustering activities.The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6. This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.

"""One of the principal levers to improve the energy efficiency, performance and range of vehicles, and reduce their impact on the environment, is to decrease their weight. This is particularly important for conventionally-powered vehicles to reduce CO2 emissions but also for EVs in which the relatively limited range and high costs, linked to the still comparatively low production volumes, remain critical factors that determine their competitiveness.Previously-conducted EU research projects have already demonstrated the fact that the adoption of advanced grades of steel, metal alloys, aluminium, novel plastics and biomaterials, novel high-strength light-weight ceramics and composites can lead to a drastic reduction in the weight of a wide range of vehicle components. However the outcome of these activities is also that the additional cost for each kilogram saved is still too high to represent a revolutionary approach enabling intensive use of such lightweight materials particularly in vehicles intended for mass-production.Correspondingly it is necessary to address this issue directly and urgently in order to identify solutions for the significant weight reduction of vehicles, and in particular electrified cars, which are cost-effective and viable with respect to the intended production volumes and from the entire life-cycle perspective, improving performance without compromising crashworthiness and durability. Specifically the principal focus should be on large production volumes exploiting economies of scale, targeting production volumes of at least 50000 units per annum, while investigating also the opportunity for developing common solutions across different types of vehicle. The principal focus should be on large production volumes exploiting economies of scale, targeting production volumes of at least 50000 units per annum, while investigating also the opportunity for developing common solutions across different types of vehicle.A holistic, integrated and cost-driven approach should be pursued in order to optimize the use of lightweight materials solutions in all vehicle structures, subsystems and components (with the exception of concepts for stand-alone powertrains), considering the entire value chain from a life-cycle perspective: materials, tools, process, assembly and end-of-life.Materials engineering should address the development of new low density/high strength and highly formable materials (e.g. steels, alloys, aluminium, castings, polymers, biomaterials, ceramics and reinforcements) and their combination (e.g. composites, sandwiches, high strength foams) at affordable prices starting from less expensive sources, also via recycling and/or processes which are less energy-demanding. Furthermore, materials engineering should address corrosion, thermal expansion, joining (e.g. bonding, riveting, friction-stir based technologies, etc.) and recycling issues of multi-material designs, one essential prerequisite being the widespread availability and minimal CO2 footprint of the candidate materials.Manufacturing engineering should address both the need to use less energy-intensive and more sustainable technologies, and the opportunity to speed-up and improve the efficiency of lightweight part production also through the combination of different manufacture steps, moving towards new approaches specific for new materials, including cost-effective multi-material joining technologies as well as the formability of tailored blanks material hybrid parts, and considering also effective multi-material surface treatments.Design should pursue approaches based on both “right material for the right application” and “multi-functional optimization” in order to exploit the lightweight materials properties, optimizing their use through functional integration of multi-material solutions, including design for recycling. In view to further reduce the environmental footprint of the vehicles, the use of recycled high added-value materials should be considered.Virtual engineering should support the multi-functional design for the optimization of performance (including crashworthiness, durability, etc.), developing and applying methods and tools to enable the efficient and effective simulation of multi-functional, multi-material solutions as well as of sustainable manufacturing technologies in order to minimize material use and energy consumption. Importantly Life Cycle Analysis (LCA should support the entire design and development process.The activities are required to identify solutions for the weight reduction of vehicles, including, but not limited to, electrified cars which, through a comprehensive analysis, should be demonstrated to be both viable, in terms of cost and production, and sustainable from the life-cycle perspective.The solutions must be validated at the application level, with full verification of the virtual engineering approach, to demonstrate improved performance without any compromise in terms of crashworthiness and durability. An assessment of the applicability of the solutions developed across different vehicle types is also expected.This topic is a NMBP contribution to the European Green Vehicles Initiative (EGVI) and was developed in close collaboration with EGVI.

These disorders are often of chronic duration and associated with increasing levels of disability. In the European Union, at least 1 000 000 people are affected with these disorders and many more times than that world-wide. They are often diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 when families and careers are developing and can represent the most common cause of disability affecting young adults, thereby having a strong economic impact for society in terms of healthcare costs.Proposals should focus on the development of new multifunctional biomaterials, as part of eventual Medical Devices[1] or Advanced Therapies[2], so that they can function as effective eventual therapeutic interventions. They can include biocompatible and biodegradable biomaterials as part of minimally invasive treatments and theragnostic materials. Funding for the development of new drug candidates for these conditions or for any form of clinical trial will not be considered.The development of new integrated experimental and computational approaches aimed to describe interface processes and their determinants should be considered as key step for the design of safe and performing biomaterials. Experimental protocols should be planned taking due account of current good laboratory practice (GLP) and ISO guidelines. Manufacturing processes will need to be addressed, including up scaling, good manufacturing practice (GMP), process analytical technology (PAT), technology transfer and regulatory work in respect of relevant regulations as appropriate[3][4]. At least one type of tissue engineering construct should be delivered at the end of the research project together with a proof of concept of its therapeutic potential and preclinical validation.In order to ensure relevance and impacts of the research efforts, the active participation of industrial partners and clinicians represents an added value to the proposals and this will be reflected in the evaluation under the criterion “Impact”.

"""Many biomolecules (e.g. proteins, peptides, nucleic acid, enzymes), in opposition to classical small molecules, have demonstrated interesting therapeutic activities in vitro. However, they are too often not druggable because once in pre-clinical in vivo development, they show disappointing loss of efficacy and/or unacceptable toxicity. For example, a high in vitro efficacy of a therapeutic biomolecule can disappointedly become low in vivo, because the biomolecule is processed by the immune system or by enzymes of the host before reaching its targeted tissue. Nanotechnology represents a promising opportunity to overcome these drawbacks. Indeed, the formulation of nanocarriers containing biomolecules ('biologicals') for drug/vaccine delivery can greatly improve their in vivo efficacy and/or decrease their toxicity and provide the capability to cross biological barriers (e.g. intestinal, blood-brain barrier, nasal, ocular, pulmonary, skin).This call addresses nanoformulation of biologicals (like proteins, peptides, nucleic acids and enzymes). With an appropriate formulation the biologicals can be effectively transported through the relevant biological barriers to the targeted organs, tissues and cells.Formulation of nanomedicines has in general been empirical and often produced in an amorphous or undefined structure, which produces regulatory and manufacturing control issues. The aim of the research is to achieve excellent quality control of the assembly by using self-assembling systems. The resulting processes should provide a high degree of control over the physico-chemical parameters like shape, size and chemical composition while incorporating non-Lipinski molecules such as nucleics acids, proteins or peptides. Characterisation aspects of the nanoformulations therefore have to be properly addressed. The benefit will be easier manufacturing and process control, as well as optimised nanoformulation of biologicals with tailored transport through biological barriers.Projects will develop a nanoformulation of biomolecules to provide a solid pre-clinical proof of concept, address scale-up to the quantities needed for late pre-clinical and clinical study and prepare for future clinical testing.

At the same a new generation of highly flexible production and process technologies and equipment, such as 3D-printing, has become available, enabling industry to adapt faster to the market demand and to produce in smaller series.All European companies, especially SMEs, need to have access to technology infrastructure with appropriate manufacturing facilities to help them develop their innovative product-services from the early stage of feasibility assessment up to the fabrication of first series of prototype's products. Purchasing is not always the best option.It is also important to develop value systems that take into account the new extended supply chain from the early stage of the design process up to the end-of-life activities. In addition, the real production can nowadays take place anywhere in the world and leave Europe with unused or outdated production capacities. The current overall process does not necessarily take into account economic, social and environmental benefits for Europe.Business models supporting the novel supply chains for innovative product-services would need to facilitate the flow of information on free utilisation capacity among service providers, which could be dedicated business set-ups for that kind of product-services, or just existing manufacturers with free production capacity at certain moments in time and business companies seeking short term solutions for their capacity shortages.New equipment, internet, digital technologies and social media have the potential to support new supply chain models that are focused on business-to-business (B2B) as well as business-to-consumer (B2C) relationships, on improving the use of manufacturing capacity in Europe.Solutions should facilitate the flow of information on free manufacturing capacity among service providers (which could be dedicated businesses or existing manufacturers with spare capacity).The research activities should focus on all of the following areas:Project activities will focus on new concepts and methodologies for knowledge-based, specialised product-service, which can fulfil the requirements of fast changing markets for innovative product-services.

There is a need for a Business Decision Support System that supports the selection of the optimal material and process taking into account the implementation costs but also the associated risks, uncertainties and costs related to the modelling and simulation; a priority, especially for SMEs.The proposals should develop an integrated Business Decision Support System (BDSS) that can support decisions on new materials and new processes by calculating through hypothetical scenarios.The BDSS should enable the integration of materials modelling and business tools and databases into a single work-flow, allowing for flexibility of application to different industrial sectors.Proposals should create a framework that allows the flexible integration of existing or future discrete and continuum materials models with structured and unstructured data from multiple data bases containing materials data, commercial data and information on market trends, pricing, customer needs and demands.The BDSS should enable a multi-criteria optimisation over all stages of product development by allowing the end-user to mirror the operational framework of their company. The structure of the BDSS should allow back-engineering from the end-goal. BDSS should be designed such as to optimise the integration of humans in new more complex industrial environments. The tool should be available to and usable by decision makers in manufacturing companies in the form of a platform which can be confidentially applied by a company.The tool should be validated against measurements, existing data and real financial arguments.

"""Nanomaterials are very diverse groups of materials with greatly varying properties. Thorough physico-chemical characterisation of nanomaterials, in their pristine forms but also in the tested environment, is nowadays being recognised as essential for sound assessment of their biological and environmental properties. In order to enable prediction of impacts, itself nowadays a pre-requirement for insuring industrial activity, a classification based on key parameters or biological interactions should be established and scientific foundations established on very well defined and characterised systems. Yet, suitable analytical techniques, instrumentation and equipment for the testing of nanomaterials properties, skilful operators, and inter-laboratory studies that would establish confidence are still lacking, even in the “simple”, and most addressed, case of particle size distribution measurements which many laboratories struggle to tackle adequately when confronted with poly-dispersed materials. At the lower limits of the nano-scale these same problems aggravate further. An additional factor is the high cost of the available techniques something that hinders smaller laboratories, innovation oriented SMEs, and discourages start-ups.The objective is to develop new, or further improve, relevant analytical methods and corresponding equipment, relevant to hazard and exposure testing strategies, that enable characterisation of ensembles of nanomaterials particle sizes, complex shapes, surface area and surface chemistry, coating stability or multiple composition (multicomposites engineered nanomaterials), including the necessary building up of confidence through benchmarking. The analytics could also enable studying the longer term fate of particles following their interactions with in complex matrices, i.e. in living systems, or longer term environmental fate, e.g. after wear and tear or weathering.Established methods, including related equipment, should be brought to Technology Readiness Level 6 and beyond, whereas those based on new concepts are expected to reach TRL 5.This topic is part of the open data pilot.This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs and for international cooperation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""The rapid expansion of nanotechnology has brought the question of the safety of the emerging applications and the risk management measures. Considerable effort has been put by FP6 and FP7 projects for answering basis scientific and technical questions and will continue under H2020. There is a need to support regulatory aspects by providing the technology, skills and conventions necessary for implementation of existing rules and consistent development of new ones. This supposes developing the capacity to routinely assess and reduce risks in regulatory terms, both for toxicity and exposure, and the capacity to develop and implement safe-by-design processes and products with the aim of keeping risk level below pre-defined values.The objective of this topic is to support safe innovation related aspects by providing the technology, skills, and processes, necessary for science-based best NanoSafety practices in industrial and commercial activities.This objective is being addressed by nano-risk excellence centres currently being established in several EU member states and globally. A wide variety of national and (EU) regional platforms and centres can be observed which are dedicated to research, market follow-up, dissemination of nanosafety. There is the need to consolidate and further develop these first initiatives so as to make available to industry and other stakeholders concerned a European-wide, up-to-date, science-based, organisational structure capable of managing risks and supporting safe innovation. It should also ensure providing scientific support to more general questions on product quality, technical approvals, counterfeiting, training and certification system for nanosafety at work and providing reliable information for the public.The proposed CSA should aim at networking these platforms, including the nanosafety cluster, at European level and cooperate with third countries. The foundation and basis for the development of the European nano-network will be based on the interaction and adequate communication to generate a step-change in the risk management process. It may include work and resources specific to the participants or other public and private sources. The CSA can be used to pool resources and organise calls for market oriented activities which are of common interest for the platforms.To ensure fast transfer of knowledge from basic research to market implementation, the proposed CSA should strengthen and support the Nanosafety Cluster activities, in particular those aiming at communication and outreach.This topic is part of the open data pilot.In line with the objectives of the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012) 497), international cooperation according to the current rules of participation is encouraged, in particular with Brazil, South Korea and the United States of America.

"""The number of available nanomaterials is growing rapidly and testing each material thoroughly is virtually impossible. For convincingly managing eventual risk, precise quantification of hazards and exposure would be necessary for all cases and engineering-out or reducing risk must follow in cases of non-acceptable risks. All engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) would need characterising along all value chains and all used media and physiological chemistries. It is therefore essential to set the basis for an appropriate and sustainable framework and define strategies towards ENMs classification, grouping (categorisation for further purposes) and read-across for risk analysis in a regulatory perspective.The existing and rapidly progressing knowledge in this domain, in terms of characterisation of material properties and of possible adverse effects from their applications, is expected to allow for classification of ENMs based on morphology, composition, complexity/functionality, and by bio or eco-interactions. The classification approaches should aim to support grouping of ENMs for further risk analysis, to help in developing intelligent testing strategies and identifying ""ENMs properties of concern"" that need to be tested more thoroughly. Methods for grouping and for read-across within or between groups, should be defined to reduce unnecessary efforts in testing. Grouping can take into account quantification of possible adverse effects depending on the use on ENMs in specific applications. Results from these studies should be collected and combined in a consistent and progressive system enabling both the integration of newer data and the use of raw and aggregated data for regulatory purposes. Particular attention should be paid to supporting safer-by-design practices, so that novel products containing ENMs provide the benefits originally claimed by maintaining fullest possible intended functionality and at the same time pose the least possibly risks to humans, the environment and ecosystem services. The proposed projects should include appropriate data curation expertise, modelling (including development of theoretical models if appropriate) and input into the possible development of Q(n)SP/AR approaches in order to develop user friendly interfaces to enable data driven predictions from other ENMs with similar properties or behaviour, and predictive risk assessment tools.Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7This topic is part of the open data pilot.This topic is particularly suitable for international cooperation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Risk assessment is often largely based on the toxicological profile of the material in question. The reason is that the costs related to hazard assessment are usually not in balance with the costs for exposure monitoring, let alone risk containment or risk mitigation. However with the very big number of new material likely to enter production and use, the usually short period between development and marketing and the increase in societal risk aversion, the classical toxicological testing paradigm so far focusing on in vivo testing is gradually but steadily shifting towards in-vitro and in-silico testing approaches. This is particularly true in the field of nanosafety where, in front of potentially thousands of different nanomaterials, economic constraints make it essential to develop and establish robust, fast and yet reliable and realistic methods that should be applied in figuring out ""nanomaterials of concern"".Significant progresses have been made in assessing nanomaterial hazard. Yet, knowledge gaps remain on long-term effects (low doses, chronic exposure), both for human health and the environment. Questions also arise on the adequacy of the models used in existing in-vitro and in-silico testing and on the relevance of the exposure conditions (e.g. linked to the current understanding of the nanomaterial-biomolecule-cell interface) to correctly assess and predict real-life hazards. It is also necessary to prepare the ground for the next challenge, defining hazard profiles based on in-silico testing alone.With a view to intelligent testing strategies (ITS) for nanomaterials, it is of high priority to develop and adopt realistic and advanced in vitro tests which have the potential to substantially improve the relevance of in-vitro approaches. Current in-vitro experiments mostly rely on established immortalized single cell lines, which often do not reflect the in-vivo situation. Therefore, new or advanced models, such as co-culture models, 3D cultures or primary cell models should be developed for relevant endpoints lacking, or having inadequate, in-vitro models. Transport through biological barriers could also be addressed, for instance with the objective of assessing the true internal dose of the materials to which living organisms are being exposed, as well as disease models or models with impaired barriers.Low-level chronic exposure is a likely scenario as many ENMs will probably exist at very low concentrations in the environment and potentially be persistent. Thus, assays and models with low chronic exposure, elucidating toxicokinetics, different mechanisms of action and adverse outcome pathways, as well as specific disease models, should be developed and assessed against appropriate animal studies and could include for instance effects on kinetics, growth, reproduction, metabolism, and behaviour. Research could also focus on long-term, ecologically relevant, effects in realistic environmental concentrations of ENMs.The transformations in biological or environmental matrices have been demonstrated as having potentially significant effect on the ENM tests results. Therefore, dosing with realistic exposure levels and conditions should be an integral part of the developments, taking into consideration the dynamic and complex nature of environmentally induced transformations with realistic external and internal forms and levels of exposure.For validation purposes and to ensure that the experimental results can form a solid and meaningful basis for grouping, read-across, and modelling purposes, the testing should be performed on sets of well-defined and characterised libraries of nanomaterials and, when possible, on nanomaterials for which high-quality in-vivo data are already existing (to minimize animal testing).Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4 to 6.This topic is part of the open data pilot.This topic is particularly suitable for international cooperation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 10 and 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

The project must ensure a strong degree of policy alignment and be designed to deliver useful outcomes to relevant policy initiatives and innovation partnerships, such as European Technology Platforms.Supporting activities to be undertaken in the project could include the empowering of stakeholders to co-create nanotechnology research and innovation by enabling them to formulate and communicate their needs and concerns, and designing ways to give them a voice in R&I processes. Additional activities could also include the development of: teaching material and the training of researchers and engineers in ways to include societal considerations in their work; training of researchers/scientists in science communication; establishing a 'journalist in the lab' exchange scheme; the development of balanced, reliable and easily accessible information on how nanotechnology is contributing to solving specific societal challenges and is used in daily life, e.g. published by the mass media with supplements and media micro sites or using existing multimedia and other relevant technology; guidance on how to bring about institutional changes that may contribute to a better engagement of civil society in nanotechnology-relevant R&I organisations; and policy recommendations on how best to integrate societal considerations in nanotechnology research & innovation.This action is to be based on the concept of Mobilisation & Mutual Learning (MML) platforms. Proposals should include the appropriate disciplines of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Gender aspects should be taken into account.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1.5 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Europe’s highly diverse and rich cultural heritage (CH) is seen as a powerful common background that provides a sense of belonging amongst and between European citizens. Next to this societal impact, CH has also significant economic impact through activities such as tourism, restoration, maintenance, and cultural industry. However, tangible CH is endangered by significant deterioration of voluntary or involuntary anthropogenic origin and by other threats.20th century cultural heritage is often confronted with different deterioration mechanisms than more ancient cultural heritage for reasons such as the use of modern materials. This requires additional research efforts regarding material composition, ageing processes, and the development of appropriate conservation technologies. While modelling and simulation based approaches in the development of advanced materials and devices play nowadays an important role, there is a need for development in the area of CH conservation.Two main elements should be addressed:The proposed materials/techniques are expected to ensure long term protection and security of cultural heritage, taking into account environmental and human risk factors. An environmental impact assessment of the proposed solutions is to be included to ensure the development of sustainable and compatible materials and methods. Focus on innovative and long-lasting solutions in the conservation of cultural assets is expected.Projects are encouraged to base their modelling software development on on-going efforts in the development of open simulation platforms and to use to a large extent existing models. Projects should have an element of model validation based on experimental data. The majority of resources is expected to be invested in the actual material/technology development and testing, rather than the development of new models.Standardisation and/or the production of (certified) reference materials and/or pre-normative research should be an integral part of the project.The projects should present clearly measurable objectives for the proposed developments. The core activities regarding the materials/techniques are expected to reach TRL 6 by the end of the project.A participation of relevant SSH disciplines is expected. SSH research should contribute criteria for targeting specific cultural heritage and analyse the expected long-term societal spill-over effects of the project.Projects are expected to contribute actively to on-going activities e.g. in the EMMC (European Materials Modelling Council), and EU funded clusters.The implementation of this topic is intended to start at TRL 4 and target TRL 6. A significant participation of SMEs with R&D capacities is encouraged.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 6 and 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Following the recent crisis, a key European priority is re-industrialisation, that is, the re-introduction and expansion of industry. Industry, and the manufacturing sector in particular, is important for Europe because it can create sustainable growth and jobs.New digital technologies and advances in key enabling technologies provide unique opportunities for productivity gains as well as addressing new markets. A key feature in the latest industrial revolution is the linking of the physical and digital worlds through 'cyber-physical systems', which has the potential of making European industrial system truly flexible, resilient, resource efficient, human centred and highly competitive. Europe has to build on its strong capacities in all key enabling technologies (KETs); capitalise on digital technologies and systems; and bring smart manufacturing to innovative enterprises as well as traditional industries, including SMEs.A re-industrialisation of Europe will have positive effects also in the context of the circular economy. New technologies help to make products, services, manufacturing and processing cleaner, safer, and more flexible in responding to customers' needs; and they help to use materials and energy as efficiently as possible and to reduce waste and emissions. Europe has stringent legislation for clean industry, including rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to foster energy efficiency. The more production is transferred back to Europe, the cleaner industry becomes.At the same time, a fit-for-purpose eco-system needs to be created around these innovative technologies, to allow industry to be globally competitive and sustainable.Proposals should assess the contribution of relevant EU projects in the area of KETs, e.g. pilot lines and demonstrators, to the vision of re-industrialisation in the context of the circular economy, as outlined in the specific challenge.Proposals should build on the roadmaps of relevant European initiatives, such as the Factories of the Future and Sustainable Process Industries cPPPs, as well as relevant EU, national and regional initiatives supporting the transformation towards a more sustainable and competitive EU manufacturing industry.Proposals should provide the evidence for the impact of R&I on industrial innovation and investments, growth and jobs, identifying also appropriate policy and public actions to further foster private investment into industrial and manufacturing.Deliverables are expected in all of the following specific areas: The analysis and strategy work should also take into account ""future of work"" and social aspects as well as managers' and consumer behaviour aspects. Appropriate contributions from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) are therefore essential to the success of these activities.Complementarity should be sought between this work and the work in the ICT part of Factories of the Future (notably topic FoF-12-2017 on ICT Innovation for Manufacturing SMEs (I4MS)) in the effort of supporting the transformation of the EU's industrial fabric.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1000000 and 1500000, and having a duration not exceeding 18 months, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""The constant discovery of vulnerabilities in ICT components, applications, services and systems is placing our entire digital society at risk. Insecure ICT is also imposing a significant cost on users (individuals and organisations) who have to mitigate the resulting risk by implementing additional technical and procedural measures which are resource consuming.Smart systems, highly connected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are introducing a high dynamism in the system to develop and validate. Hence, CPS are evolving in a complex and dynamic environment, making safety-critical decisions based on information from other systems not known during development.Another key challenge is posed by domains, such as medical devices, critical infrastructure facilities, and cloud data centres, where security is deeply intertwined and a prerequisite for other trustworthiness aspects such as safety and privacy.The challenges are further intensified by the increasing trend of using third party components for critical infrastructures, by the ubiquity of embedded systems and the growing uptake of IoT as well as the deployment of decentralized and virtualized architectures.In order to tackle these challenges, there is a need of appropriate assurances that our ICT systems are secure and trustworthy by design as well as a need of certified levels of assurance where security is regarded as the primary concern. Likewise, target architectures and methods improving the efficiency of assurance cases are needed in order to lower their costs.a. Research and Innovation Actions - AssuranceProviding assurance is a complex task, requiring the development of a chain of evidence and specific techniques during all the phases of the ICT Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC for short: e.g. design verification, testing, and runtime verification and enforcement) including the validation of individual devices and components. These techniques are complementary yet all necessary, each of them independently contributing towards improving security assurance. It includes methods for reliability and quality development and validation of highly dynamic systems.Proposals may address security, reliability and safety assurance at individual phases of the SDLC and are expected to cover at least one of the areas identified below, depending on their relevance to the proposal overall objectives:Proposal should strive to quantify their progress beyond the state of the art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Particular importance within this context should be placed on determining the appropriate metrics.Proposals should take into account the changing threat landscape, where targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats assume an increasingly more important role and address the challenge of security assurance in state-of-the-art development methods and deployment models including but not limited to solutions focussing on reducing the cost and complexity of assurance in large-scale systems.Proposals should include a clear standardisation plan at submission time.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.b. Innovation Actions – Security CertificationProposals should address the challenge of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of existing security certification processes for state-of-the-art ICT components and products including the production and delivery of the corresponding guidance materials.In terms of effectiveness, proposals should address, amongst other factors, emerging threats, compositional certification and reuse of components in the context of certified systems and certification throughout the operational deployment of a product or a service.In terms of efficiency, proposals should strive to reduce the cost and duration of the certification process.Proposals may address security certification in any area of their choice. Consortia submitting proposals are expected to approach the selected topic as widely as possible including all necessary actors – e.g. industry, academia, certification laboratories - and involve the relevant certification authorities from at least three Member States in order to achieve added value at a European level.Proposals are encouraged to work towards moderate to high assurance level protection profiles as a way to validate their results.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Europe's SMEs, local public administration and citizens face particular challenges in addressing basic cyber security threats.On one hand, in the case of SMEs and local public administration, their size and budgetary constraints often precludes them from putting in place highly granular organisational structures, retaining dedicated information security personnel and making significant investments in cybersecurity products or services.Individuals, constantly portrayed as the ""weakest link"" face the daunting task of having to constantly adapt their behaviour at home and in the workplace and the way they use both their personal or work-related IT equipment and devices in order to avoid falling prey to the latest threats and techniques that malicious actors leverage against them.Moreover, whether addressing SMEs, local public administrations or individuals, few cyber security solutions have been designed with the human factor in mind and therefore present severe limitations in their usability which hampers proper decision making and adequate usage.Taking into consideration the adequate level of security commensurate with the considered use-case, proposals may address one of the following types of end-users:To identify the most wide spread threats and cyber security issues facing end-users, proposals should take into account the guidance documents, best practices and standards issued by International Standardisation Organisations, technical forum and Member State Authorities which are tailored for SMEs or Individuals and actively contribute to their development or improvement.Proposals should develop innovative solutions with a high degree of usability and automation while ensuring that the end-users retain an adequate degree of cyber situational awareness and control.Factors going beyond technological solutions and focusing on psychological and behavioural factors (including gender) that affect cyber security at individual or organizational levels should be addressed.Proposals are expected to validate their work through extensive end-user feedback and participation in the consortium where appropriate.Proposals have to address the specific needs of the end-user, private and public security end users alike.

"""In line with technological developments and emerging threats, the improvement of performance and efficiency of cryptographic solutions is a persistent need across ICT.Proposals may address one or more of the areas/challenges described below but not necessarily all of them:- Functional encryption solutions that offer more flexibility and make it feasible to process encrypted data held on the Internet. Research should aim for solutions beyond the current only partial homomorphic encryption algorithms under development.Activities should also deal with measurement of information leaked when allowing for flexibility and preserving data formats. Additionally, means to reduce this leakage (e.g., anonymization or obfuscation) should be researched.- For application areas such as the Internet of Things, implantable medical devices and sensor nodes that harvest energy from the environment there is a need for ultra-lightweight cryptology. Additional means to protect privacy in these applications (e.g. anonymity in communications) should be developed.Even if Moore’s law would hold for the next 10-15 years, the progress in bandwidth and storage capacity grows faster than the computing power; and so this means that there is a need for ultra-high-speed cryptographic algorithms that are fully parallelizable and energy efficient as well as high speed encryption applied directly to the physical layer, for example using quantum cryptography. This challenge is related to the challenge of ultra-lightweight cryptology but the optimization target is very different and hence completely different designs are expected.- Implementation (hardware or software) is often the weak point of the strongest cryptographic protocols: physical cryptanalysis, including tampering, side channel, faults injection attacks, has to be taken into account in the early phases of a development. A specific attention should be paid to the security of the implementation and its validation.While development tools today include support for good software practices that avoid many common implementation errors, these tools insufficiently support good practices that can bring cyber-secure primitives and applications. Therefore, more progress is needed in the development of toolkits that integrate encryption seamless in their toolbox environment.- Authenticated encrypted token research for mobile payment solutions and related applications. Most currently existing payment solutions emulate a credit or debit card payment scheme. Tokenized payment solutions can effectively reduce the risk of cyber-fraud and open options for alternative payment options to European citizens. The proposals should aim to create a real e-currency without compromising security or opening doors for criminals. Different projects may be envisaged, such as an e-€ wallet that can be held on a mobile and used to pay anywhere anytime combining convenience, flexibility and security without compromising the instrument with (inflated) transaction costs or possible criminal misuses.- Innovative cryptographic primitives and complementary non-cryptographic privacy-preserving mechanisms to enforce privacy at various levels (e.g. pairing based cryptography).- New techniques, such as quantum safe cryptography, which are secure from quantum computers and other advances in computing and cryptanalysis.- Proposals on quantum key distribution addressing challenges such as improved performance (higher bit rates, increased loss and noise resilience), network integration (coexistence on existing infrastructure) and the development of new protocols beyond key distribution. Proposals on quantum key distribution should include experimentation and validation with end-users in realistic and relevant scenarios such as for mobile communication backhauling, optical access networks or data-centre to data-centre communication.- Automated proof techniques for cryptographic protocols.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 million and EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Professional applications are covering different market segments. Precision agriculture, mapping and surveying have been the pioneers in the use of GNSS since the early years. The challenge is to make these applications more affordable, easy to use and integrated with other solutions and technologies, including for example earth observation, e.g. Copernicus services, in order to enable new targeted innovative solutions. EGNSS is offering additional accuracy and features, such as multiple frequencies and the high precision service in the frame of the future commercial service, contributing to enabling these innovative solutions, including in challenging environments. Power networks, telecommunication networks and financial transactions[1] are today synchronised, many of them using GNSS. These networks are becoming more and more distributed (e.g. distributed power generation of renewable energies), interconnected and more demanding in terms of synchronisation performances (e.g. in 4G-LTE and future internet), or requiring authenticated solutions as for the financial transaction time stamping. The specific challenge is in this case to build on the enhanced capabilities offered by Galileo that will provide high accurate timing information and authentication services, to develop a new generation of high performing, reliable and EU independent timing and synchronisation applications that can cope with these emerging and demanding needs.Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, building also on the combination of EGNSS with earth observation and Copernicus services, with commercial impact or with satellite communication. Proposals should have a clear market uptake perspective. Below are some areas which are identified as especially promising for further EGNSS application development:Agriculture: Automated machine guidance, precision farming and machine control and field boundary measurements are possible areas to be addressed.Surveying and Mapping: Land survey, marine survey, cadastral and geodesy, and construction are possible areas to be addressed.Timing and Synchronisation: Telecommunications, power generation and finance are possible areas to be addressed.Other professional applications: clearly demonstrating amongst others the contribution of EGNSS differentiators, the potential of integration with earth observation data, and the future commercial potential are also invited.For all the professional areas, the development and innovation should build on:EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s).

Specifically for agriculture the expected impact is also to improve the productivity and decrease the environmental impact. For timing and synchronisation applications, the expected impact is to contribute to cope with emerging network synchronisation needs in terms of accuracy and robustness, while contributing to improve EU dependency from other GNSS.[1]Cf. also Article 50 of Directive 2014/65/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments.""","""theme"""

While some public health problems are specific to countries, and health care systems are different. Member States still face many similar challenges. There are many public health problems common to most countries, such as the burden posed by chronic diseases, multi-morbidity or obesity, and mental health issues.

It implies, among others, strategies for strengthening community care and primary care in relation to social care and prevention, redesigning hospital care and de-institutionalising long term care with more care provided closer to home. This implies placing more emphasis on self-management of patients and new ways of linking health and social care. There are many opportunities to learn from one another on what works best under what conditions, agreeing on what issues could be best researched jointly, and where the problems are more localized.

The aspiration to provide more effective therapeutic interventions tailored to the individual or groups of individuals with common molecular phenotypes remains unfulfilled because of the variable response of individuals to such interventions.Patient stratification aims at grouping patients into disease sub-groups, where the specific pathological processes involved are better defined (clinical/molecular phenotypes). This will lead to the development of targeted therapies, optimizing the intervention to individual patients, thus achieving greater success in treating or curing the patient.Proposals should deliver novel concepts for disease-mechanism based patient stratification to address the needs for stratified or personalised therapeutic interventions. The proposals should integrate multidimensional and longitudinal data and harness the power of -omics, including pharmacogenomics, systems biomedicine approaches, network analysis and of computational modelling. The new concepts of stratification should be validated in pre-clinical and clinical studies taking into account sex and gender differences. Applicants are encouraged to actively involve patient associations. The proposals should consider regulatory aspects of clinical practice and commercialisation opportunities. Proposals should focus on complex diseases having high prevalence and high economic impact.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Rare diseases are diseases which affect not more than 5 per 10 000 persons in the European Union. It is estimated that rare diseases encompass between 6 000 and 8 000 different entities which affect altogether more than 30 million people in the EU. However, patient populations for individual rare diseases are small and dispersed, which makes international collaboration crucial. Despite the recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases, today many rare diseases still lack means of molecular diagnosis. An accurate molecular diagnosis is an essential starting point for the understanding of mechanisms leading to diseases as well as for adequate patient management and family counselling and it paves the way for therapy development.The aim of this research should be to apply genomics and/or other –omics and/or other high-throughput approaches for the molecular characterisation of rare diseases in view of developing molecular diagnoses for a large number of undiagnosed rare diseases. Undiagnosed rare diseases may range from a group of unnamed disorders with common characteristics to a phenotypically well described disease or group of diseases with an unknown molecular basis. Genetic variability due to geographical distribution and/or different ethnicity should be taken into account as well as genotype-phenotype correlation whenever applicable. In addition, age, sex and gender aspects should be included where appropriate. This large-scale proposal should promote common standards and terminologies for rare disease classification and support appropriate bioinformatics tools and incentives to facilitate data sharing. Existing resources should be used for depositing data generated by this proposal. Molecular and/or functional characterisation may be part of the proposal to confirm diagnosis. The proposal should enable and foster scientific exchange between stakeholders from countries and regions with different practices and strategies of rare disease diagnostics.The selected proposal shall contribute to the objectives of, and follow the guidelines and policies of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium IRDiRC (www.irdirc.org).The Commission considers that requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""A major hurdle in reliable risk assessment and management of chemicals is the lack of harmonised information about the exposure of citizens, including workers, to chemicals and their interplay with other concurrent environmental exposures and impact on health. Each individual is today exposed to a large number of chemicals in their environment, including the workplace, through the air, food, water and consumer products. For many of the chemicals, the health impact, including long-term, is still unknown. Innovative approaches are needed to enable us to decipher the potential causal associations between exposures and health effects over a lifetime and, where such links are identified, to understand the underlying mechanisms.A first step to better assess and understand this potential impact on heath is to gather harmonised and comparable information on population exposure to chemicals in Europe through human biomonitoring (HBM), to link this information to data on exposure sources and epidemiological surveys and to promote research on the exposure-response relationships in humans.The objective is to create a European joint programme for monitoring and scientific assessment of human exposures to chemicals and potential health impacts in Europe, building on previous activities undertaken at EU and national levels.

Potential research aspects to be addressed are, inter alia, related to developing innovative analytical methods, including in atypical biological matrices, non-invasive technologies, new biomarkers, and reference materials. A network of reference laboratories and field survey entities of high quality must be established, engaged in capacity building across Europe and facilitating access to special equipment. Best practices for management of data resulting from linking analytical results and field surveys must be established, facilitating the data inclusion into the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring Data (IPChem platform[2]) currently under development by the EU Joint Research Centre.The EHBMI should ensure the inclusion of new HBM data and whenever possible existing HBM data to IPChem and address outstanding issues related to HBM data policy and data quality assurance. Furthermore, the consortium should ensure that the new data, relevant for policy making, produced in this initiative, will be made available to regulators at the national and EU level. For this purpose the proposal should include a draft Data Management Plan, renewed annually, detailing what data the project will generate, how it will be used and/or made accessible for regulatory purposes.The research programme to understand the impact of exposures on human health should include joint research on correlation, integration and analysis of data from different sources, e.g., HBM data, environmental, occupational, health examination and epidemiological surveys; research on exposure mechanisms and modes of actions and research for innovative approaches to risk assessment.The work undertaken under the science-policy interface component should aim at informing existing policy making processes (from chemicals to health) at EU and national level about the outcome of the EHBMI, exploring the possibilities and requirements for an increased use of HBM data in evidence-based policy processes and mobilising existing committees and expert/advisory groups to contribute to setting priorities.Research activities may be supported by open calls for proposals organised by the consortium, if deemed necessary, aiming at bringing in additional expertise and engaging with the wider research community.Dissemination, communication and training activities should be included in the initiative, in particular efforts to increase public awareness and understanding of the obtained results and their implications for policy making and self-responsible lifestyle management.

This might include (as early clinical pipeline gate-criteria) considerations of the optimal route and immunization regime, field-deployment logistics (e.g. storing temperatures), as well as an evaluation of the predicted cost and affordability of final vaccine products. If relevant, an assessment of the target population risk-perception attitudes and immunization behaviours should be made and sex- and gender differences should be taken into account.Both types of proposals should take into account existing mapping exercises on vaccine candidates, as well as the current vaccine development roadmaps and target product profiles for each disease (e.g. Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap).The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million for smaller specifically focused proposals, and between EUR 15 and 20 million for the larger platform proposals, would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Mental and behavioural disorders including addictive behaviour place immense burdens on individuals, families and society; they also increase the risk of co-morbidities and social exclusion. Childhood and adolescence are crucial periods for laying the foundations for healthy development and mental well-being. There is compelling evidence that promotion of mental well-being and prevention interventions, when implemented effectively, can reduce risk factors for mental disorders, enhance protective factors for good mental and physical health and lead to lasting positive effects on a range of educational, social and economic outcomes for young people[2]. Medical and psychological factors, family and social factors (including working conditions) as well as digital environments are some of the different determinants impacting the health and well-being of the young. Resilience to adversity will enhance their ability to cope. There is a need for more robust evidence on resilience factors and on effective interventions promoting mental well-being. Developing these in the young offers the possibility of a positive influence on child development in critical/sensitive periods (childhood, adolescence, transition to young adulthood), thanks to early neuroplasticity.Proposals should develop population-oriented primary prevention[3] interventions to promote mental well-being of young people and assess them for their effectiveness. The interventions should build on but may go beyond existing state-of-the art knowledge on biological, psychological and social determinants of mental well-being such as societal, cultural, work life, lifestyle, epidemiological, economic and environmental perspectives. The proposals should aim at increasing resilience and mitigating the impact of biological, psychosocial and environmental risk factors.

"""There is continuous progress in systems medicine, multi-scale modelling and patient-specific modelling aspects. But these opportunities have been inconstantly explored for the entire chain of health and disease. Thus, there are very few in well-being, prevention or rehabilitation while these areas are crucial for reducing healthcare needs, building sustainable healthcare and for assuring a healthy and motivated workforce. More, innovative methods are needed for better understanding and analysing brain, neurobiological and the gut-brain axis and the stress-related disorders or whole body data (e.g. where the development of multiscale and high spatiotemporal resolution imaging methods are critical) and their interactions with social, environmental, lifestyle, occupational, economic etc. factors that promote well-being and health. Well-being is a consequence of resilience to challenges and illness and of better prevention adapted to predispositions and behaviours (including gender), of better consideration given to the functional troubles, of better recovery and rehabilitation after illness.Proposals should aim at the development of new integrative dynamic computer-models and simulation systems of acceptable validity, with the potential to being reused, build on open service platforms and with application in well-being, health and disease. The projects have to support computer modelling and simulations able to aggregate various information sets e.g. molecular, biochemical, medical imaging, social, lifestyle, economic, occupational, microbiome, environmental, developmental, psychological, gender etc. into robust predictors for resilience in coping with and overcoming challenges and stresses and for recovery after challenges and illness. They will process and apply individual/patient-specific information in a multi-scale approach required for integrating information at a certain biological level within a wider context (at least one biological level from molecule to entire body). Proposals will focus on multi-disciplinary research in medicine, SSH and ICT and should take advantage when relevant of existing large databases in clinical medicine, biomedical or occupational research, environmental sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), so enabling and facilitating the accumulation and relinking of complex and heterogeneous data collections.

"""A defining characteristic of today’s data-rich society is the collection, storage, processing and analysis of immense amounts of data. This characteristic is cross-sectorial and applies also to healthcare. Big Data is generated from an increasing plurality of sources and offers possibilities for new insights, for understanding human systems at the systemic level to develop personalised medicine, prevent diseases and support healthy life. Primary sources are new eHealth personal solutions, but can be extended also to more generic and commercial instruments, like mobile apps for health and well-being. In addition, social networks can be considered for integrating the social dimension in the analysis of health and well-being scenarios. It is important to assure ethical aspects of data, confidentiality, anonymity of data transfer and engagement of those who collect/ code such data in its analysis and interpretation, in order to avoid misinterpretation and inappropriate conclusions. Greater involvement of those who work within healthcare systems, patients and the public is needed.Rather than improving existing isolated systems, proposals should focus on how to better acquire, manage, share, model, process and exploit the huge amount of data to develop integrated solutions that support public health authorities of Member States and associated countries in particular in healthcare system management, long-term policy making and increase the ability to provide actionable insights at the point of care. Relevant solutions include, for example, systems for determining and monitoring the combined effects of environment, lifestyle and genetics on public health, enabling early identification of effects, both on women and men, that can have large impacts on health including lifestyle and provision of healthcare – both short term and long term as well as when interaction with other public sectors is required (e.g. physical planning). Focus should also be on the governance of Big Data in order to use it proficiently across organisations and at policy levels.

"""Zika virus (ZIKV) disease is a mosquito-borne viral disease, similar to other diseases caused by Flaviviruses (such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile) but until recently was believed to be more benign. However, the recent rapid spread of the virus in previously unaffected regions like South Pacific islands and Latin America has provided epidemiological evidence for the first time that it may be associated with neurological complications in adults and with a twentyfold increase in severe congenital brain malformations of newborns.On 1 December 2015, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) issued an Epidemiological Alert on: 'Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations, and Zika virus infection: Implications for Public Health in the Americas'[1]. On 10 December 2015 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) noted in a ZIKV Rapid Risk Assessment[2] that with the spread of the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas, the likelihood of travel-related cases in the EU is increasing. Imported and autochthonous cases in the EU Overseas Countries and Territories and the EU Outermost Regions, with onward transmission in EU Member States during the summer season in areas where Aedes albopictus or Aedes aegypti (the potential vectors) are established, cannot be excluded. In January 2016, the CDC[3] and ECDC[4] cautioned pregnant women against travel in Zika-affected countries.Research studies are urgently needed to address the reported association of ZIKV infection during pregnancy with congenital brain malformations, as well as with other neurological complications in adults. If such an association is confirmed, additional studies (e.g. on potential preventive and treatment strategies) should rapidly follow.The ongoing ZIKV outbreak has exposed the challenges associated with the implementation of urgently needed research in the Latin America region, and has underlined the need for a coordinated research network across the whole region that can rapidly respond to emerging threats. However, the ZIKV outbreak also presents an opportunity to foster the development of a regional preparedness network. Such a network would not only facilitate research against ZIKV, but would also be available to rapidly respond to any future emerging threats in Latin America.Thus the specific challenge is to set up a research network across the Latin America region to facilitate, coordinate and implement urgent research against the current ZIKV outbreak, and eventually lay the foundation for a preparedness research network against any future emerging severe infectious threats.The objective is to establish a multinational and multidisciplinary consortium across Latin America and other affected or at risk regions, able to implement the urgently needed research during the ongoing ZIKV outbreak. The proposal should address all of the following issues:The consortium is expected to collaborate with relevant initiatives already existing or under development at national, regional, and international level, in order to maximise synergy and complementarity and avoid duplication of the research efforts. Specific propositions on how this can be achieved should be included in the proposal.If more than one proposal is successful, proposals should collaborate and this should be indicated in the proposal.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 5 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Taking into consideration that, according to PAHO/WHO, Brazil is the country most severely affected by ZIKV, legal entities established in Brazil are eligible for funding.The proposed preparedness research network would have a major impact in the public health of Latin America, by:[1]http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=427&Itemid=41484&lang=en[2]http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/_layouts/forms/Publication_DispForm.aspx?List=4f55ad51-4aed-4d32-b960-af70113dbb90&ID=1407[3]http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6502e1.htm[4]http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-zika-virus-first-update-jan-2016.pdf[5]These should include emerging severe acute infections (e.g. haemorrhagic fevers, or acute respiratory, neurological or gastrointestinal infections), infections from fast-spreading multi-drug resistant pathogens, as well as emerging infections with severe complications in high-risk groups (e.g. children, elderly, pregnant women and their infants).[6]http://www.glopid-r.org/""","""theme"""
"""Mass urbanisation presents one of the most urgent challenges of the 21st century. Rapidly developing and changing industrial activities, uncontrolled urban sprawl, large, concentrated and often culturally diverse populations have created numerous complex social and health problems. Cities and urban communities have to cope with challenges related poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risks, increased frequency/severity of extreme events (floods, droughts, storms, heat waves, etc.), derelict industrial sites, dis-functioning urban areas, increased criminality, social exclusion, inequalities, marginalisation, poverty and degraded urban environments. These challenges have serious impacts on human health, quality of life, well-being and security of citizens, particularly among the less privileged social classes. Cities accounting for 72% of the European population are major contributors to climate change consuming 75% of global energy and emitting 80% of greenhouse gas generated by human activity. Growing urban populations, pollution and economic activities also place water resources under severe stress, exacerbating demand whilst affecting the quality and quantity of supply. Climate change mitigation and adaptation and the sustainable management of water resources are therefore key challenges for the cities in Europe and beyond.There is convincing but fragmented evidence that nature-based solutions can significantly enhance the climate and water resilience of cities. Furthermore nature-based solutions, by reshaping the built environment, can enhance the inclusivity, equitability and liveability of the cities, regenerate deprived districts, improve mental and physical health and quality of life for the citizens, reduce urban violence, and decrease social tensions through better social cohesion particularly for the most vulnerable groups e.g. children, elderly and people of low socioeconomic status.The challenge is therefore to provide a robust, EU-wide evidence base and develop a European reference framework on nature-based solutions for regional and local city authorities, communities, enterprises and other stakeholders about the benefits, co-benefits, cost-effectiveness and economic viability of these solutions to enhance on the one hand climate and water resilience in cities and on the other hand to address inclusive urban regeneration in cities and thus promote their large scale deployment and the creation of a global market.Projects should adopt a 'front-runner' and 'follower' cities approach, as described in more detail below, to facilitate the rapid exploitation, replication and up-scaling of the solutions and via large-scale demonstrations should aim to:Proposals shall address all of the above points.

"""District heating's share on heat supply in Europe is about 12%, with some Member States and Associated Countries having a much higher share. In order to preserve existing heating networks and to increase their efficiency, successful approaches to diagnosing and retrofitting inefficient networks, including sustainable business and organisational models, have to be widely promoted and disseminated.Many systems are old and inefficient and run using fossil fuels. These systems often have poor maintenance, high customer heat costs and limited ability for user control undermining the image of district heating. The result is that a significant number of customers disconnect from district heating networks and install individual heating systems which do not always take advantage of the potential for efficiency gains. The retrofitting of these district heating systems can offer a cost effective approach to supplying efficient heat. Schemes can include city-wide networks or networks at the district/neighbourhood level.Actions are needed to accelerate the cost effective and energy efficient retrofitting existing, inefficient district heating networks.Activities supported under this topic should replicate or develop successful technical, managerial, organisational and financial approaches and should lead to the initiation of concrete schemes that guarantee substantial primary energy savings and efficiency gains, including the use of renewable and residual sources of heat as appropriate. Proposals should engage and involve as necessary, those in charge of city networks, district heating companies, managers of buildings blocks, housing associations and other building owners/managers and end consumers. Proposals should also lead to the development of concrete regional or national action plans for the retrofitting of inefficient district heating networks.As necessary, actions should consider interventions that are needed on the building side, e.g. retrofitting and / or modifications of internal heat distribution systems and system and end user controls. They should also take into account the evolution of thermal demand in the future due to improving building energy performance standards and increased rate of building renovations.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""In order to increase the roll-out in the market of new technologies for heating and cooling, Innovation Actions are needed to bring forward combined, adaptable and plug-and-play solutions. For these to be successful, the costs and energy benefits should be further demonstrated. The challenge is therefore to develop new heating/cooling and/or hot water preparation systems and demonstrate their real potential.With the growing contribution of intermittent renewable energy sources, the use of thermal energy storage will grow in importance. The uptake of systems that use or combine renewable energy sources, energy storage or smart controls is still relatively low. Integration with other parts of the building (including historical buildings) or its services is an unresolved issue due to lack of planning and simulation tools and the lack of expertise and confidence among designers and installers. Instead, they stay with conventional heating and cooling solutions, which results in a negative lock-in effect.Packaged systems claiming high levels of energy efficiency are already available in the market; however their potential is not always demonstrated in place, which develops into a lack of trust in new solutions. Therefore, there is a need to demonstrate the real potential of the new solutions by providing information on the overall system performance to the end user.Actions are needed for the development and demonstration of cost-effective compact and fully integrated heating and cooling units installed at the building level. Applications should: demonstrate their cost-effective integration in buildings, demonstration of high values of seasonal performance, fossil fuel and/or primary energy savings considering a wide range of both new and existing buildings and allow for remote access and control. Proposals could develop methods and parameters to support design and installation of multi-component heating, cooling and/or hot water preparation solutions. Proposals should also include consumer information system on the overall system performance. In addition, remote inspection of these systems should be made possible. The solutions may include the use of renewable energy including heat pumps, co-generation, thermal storage or smart controls that should be used with the specific aim to minimise primary energy demand (gas, electricity). Proposals should take into account the need for high indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.).The focus of the solutions should be on scalability, modularity and adaptability, easy integration, assembly and installation. Quality and technical reliability are also important aspects to ensure that solutions deliver their potential. Inspection and monitoring should be considered, building upon the requirements of the EPBD[1] (articles 14 and 15). For the purposes of calculating and showcasing their energy performance, the solutions should also build upon the package labelling scheme established under regulations 811/2013 and 812/2013 (where applicable).Projects should involve producers of different heating and cooling technologies and control systems, installer associations, designers and architects.

"""There is a need to better identify, analyse, model and map resources and solutions making energy demand more efficient and match it with efficient sustainable energy sources at the least cost. Such public planning is already mandated in the Energy Efficiency Directive through the 5-yearly Comprehensive Assessment for efficient heating and cooling. This needs to be done at local, regional and national levels to help develop energy strategies and ensure their consistency at national level and with EU policies. Today only a few public authorities have the expertise, knowledge and tools to perform heat and cooling mapping and planning. The future demand on public energy planning necessitates that such modelling tools are available and used as part of the policy making processes of public authorities.Actions are needed to mainstream and further develop methods and tools of heating and cooling planning (heat planning) in the administrative practices of public authorities. Heat planning is an iterative process, as plans need to be updated regularly[1].The planning tools should be able to process large and complex data sets to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the existing energy system and the dynamic development of all relevant supply and demand elements within a given geography (generation units, renewable and residual energy sources, infrastructures, buildings' energy consumption and quantity and ‘quality’ (temperature) of the thermal supply sources and that of the demand) and allow modelling of the possible scenarios reflecting hourly, seasonal and yearly variations in supply and demand to optimally reach energy goals. The heat and cooling mapping tool should be able to link with other types of maps (e.g. spatial, infrastructure, renewable energy sources maps). It should be capable of modelling flexibility needed for integrating variable renewable energy, and demand response and enable analysing the impact of the increasing number of low energy buildings (building renovation programmes, introduction of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings).The modelling tools should be user friendly and open source yet able to model the full energy system, i.e. heating and cooling, electricity and transport. The tools should include instruction and training modules and be validated, demonstrated and piloted with the target groups.

"""In most of the existing economics energy models it is generally assumed that energy consumers behave in an economically rational way. However, empirical data show that consumers are rather 'bounded rational', because of effects such as split preferences, perceived financial barriers, lack of knowledge/ information, or the implicit costs of the transaction. The different energy efficiency policies implemented in the EU try to remove the different financial and non-financial barriers to incentive energy consumers to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency technologies.Empirical research is needed to better understand consumer's decision making to improve the design of future energy efficiency policies in such a way that existing barriers can be removed, to better reflect the behaviour of consumers in energy models and also to better reflect the impact of energy efficiency policies on the different consumers' decision making processes in energy models.Proposal should advance the current knowledge on how the different consumer groups make their energy efficiency investment decisions and how energy efficiency policies can have an impact on financial and non-financial barriers in the decision making process making use of market data, large sample-surveys and other empirical sources in addition to a theoretical analysis. As different factors influence the individual choice of consumers the empirical analysis needs to be done for all consumer groups. For households there might be differences dependent on the income level, age, education, gender, tenant/landlord etc. that should be better investigated. In addition, there might be also a geographical differentiation of consumers with regard to energy efficiency investments. The decision of other consumer groups invest in energy efficiency, like companies in the service sector, in agriculture or in industry might be influenced by other factors.In addition, research should also investigate the differentiation between possible energy efficiency investments which are influenced by different factors, e.g. decisions to invest in the renovation of buildings have a different time horizon than investments in energy efficient products (washing machine, TV etc.). Such analysis should also take into account country-specific factors.Discount rates are used in many energy models to reflect the inter-temporal decision making of consumers and to describe the economic actor's behaviour. To improve energy models the results should be based on robust empirical data to apply appropriate discount rates or other parameters to support the analysis and development of energy efficiency related policy strategies. Proposals should visualise their research results and include tailored communication activities to clearly defined target groups. Where appropriate, they should take gender issues into account. Proposals should fill knowledge gaps not yet covered by former or ongoing research projects and take into account existing macro- and microeconomic models and results of socio-economic sciences and humanities. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.Proposed actions are expected to improve the current methodologies and empirical base used to quantify the positive impacts of energy efficiency policy and to improve the evidence-base for a better development of future energy efficiency policies and energy models, evidenced for example by the number of public officers and other stakeholders influenced or references to impact assessments, strategy papers or other policy documents.""","""theme"""

"""Too much of Europe's building stock is inefficient in terms of energy use, with excessive heat losses through building envelopes and technical building systems. In addition, buildings need to contribute a greater share of renewable energy production. Too few buildings are undergoing deep renovation (whereby energy savings exceed 60% compared to pre-renovation levels) and such renovations are often too expensive. There is a need to demonstrate more cost-effective and practical ways of achieving deep renovation while reducing the time needed to renovate a building and at the same time promoting a holistic optimized approach that goes beyond the results of European and national projects, and the IEA report on Prefabricated Systems for Low Energy Renovation of Residential Buildings.Proposals should demonstrate and promote innovative processes leading in practice to more cost-effective, higher quality, holistic and faster deep renovation of buildings with less disturbance of the residents. Proposals should demonstrate the contribution to an increased rate of renovation in a specific district/city/region. The building renovations may use pre-fabricated mass manufactured components or ""plug and play"" energy and ventilation systems, including innovations needed during the on-site phase. Proposals should consider innovative integrated packages of commercially available technologies. This typically includes actions on the building envelope and on the technical building systems both including renewable energy sources and conversion and storage technologies, in order to achieve very high energy performance. The proposals could include specific solutions for historic buildings, when applicable. Means of sharing technical information on the building over its whole life cycle could also be considered[1]. Proposals should ensure that the solutions guarantee high indoor environmental quality (thermal and visual comfort, acoustics, air quality, etc.). If necessary proposals should include smart controls to allow integration with the energy grid. Embodied energy and the possibility of reusing and recycling materials at the end of a building's life are highly relevant to the building's overall life cycle, therefore these aspects should also be taken into account.Solutions should demonstrate the integration potential of innovative processes and explore how they could facilitate renovation. Proposals could make use of geo-clusters[2] to respond to specific needs and to demonstrate the potential for replication.Synergies may be considered with activities initiated under the topic LCE-17-2017.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""The control, automation and monitoring tools that can be integrated into buildings are becoming more and more sophisticated. In order to guarantee energy efficient operation, building service systems need to deliver adequate control and monitoring of building energy parameters. It is essential to develop and demonstrate interoperable energy automation, control and monitoring tools for efficient heating, domestic hot water, ventilation, cooling, lighting, shading, storage, energy generation, and other building systems while ensuring a high quality indoor environment. This includes the investigation of demand response and energy management of individual customers as well.The challenge is to integrate demand response enabling elements into Energy Management Systems and thus create 'building – energy system interaction' towards optimising, at building level, energy consumption, production and storage considering the availability and price of energy supplied via the grid. A specific challenge is that Energy Management Systems and smart home devices are often not interoperable but are linked to a certain brand, technology and/or standard. Therefore full interoperability between grids, systems and products for seamless integration of all required components in building energy management systems is crucial.At the building and building unit level (residential or non-residential) the focus should be on optimisation, integration and demonstration of cost effective and interoperable solutions, including testing of new technologies and systems in real life situations.The proposed solutions shall be demonstrated for buildings which incorporate intelligent Energy Management Systems and new technologies (smart home devices). They should ensure interoperability, evolving and adapting to the operational environment (self-learning), including indoor and outdoor conditions, the availability of energy from local RES generation, the availability and price of energy from grids and local energy storage capacities. Also the possibility of clustering individual demand response services, self-generation and storage at district level should be considered. Such solutions should be effective and resilient, ensuring low operational and maintenance costs and could include functions for predictive maintenance. Solutions should be compatible and appropriately integrated with smart grids via open standards, taking into account existing standards as well as standards under development. The proposed activities should clearly involve and engage building occupants, helping them to become an interactive part of the demand response solution, as well as better managing their energy demand. Proposals should involve energy suppliers (DSOs) and industrial technology suppliers.The topic EUB-02-2017 (""Utilities: energy management at home and in buildings"") in Part 5.i Information and Communication Technologies of the Work Programme is also relevant and addresses similar challenges.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""In industrial and service sectors, energy efficiency investments, which can lead to important energy savings beneficial for the company and society as a whole, are often not implemented due to combination of factors and barriers faced by the actors involved (employees, decision-makers, auditors, ESCO, financial community etc.).According to the Energy Efficiency Directive, large enterprises are subject to mandatory energy audits unless they are implementing an energy or environmental management system, and SMEs are encouraged to undergo energy audits within the coming years. This represents an opportunity for energy efficiency investments. However, as mentioned in the EEFIG report[1], to ensure that energy audit recommendations lead to actual implementation, it is necessary to change the approach in order to ensure that the results of energy audits provide the relevant financial data and can be addressed at board level.Energy efficiency also relies on people behaviour and improvement of the energy culture of enterprises and their supply-chain.Proposals should focus on one of the following topics:Proposals should demonstrate how the proposed activities will be continued commercially beyond the project lifetime. Involvement of relevant multiplier organisations is encouraged.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Energy represents an important part of enterprises' production costs even for non-energy intensive industries, and the availability of affordable, easy to access, energy services is one of the key business development enabler and competitiveness factor. Industrial parks play an important role in the European economy and the improvement of their energy efficiency is the main challenge of this topic. Optimising their energy efficiency can be obtained by stimulating and facilitating energy cooperation among businesses. Such cooperation can be done via clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of mutualised energy services. However, there are a number of barriers that hinder the development of energy cooperation of neighbouring businesses. These barriers are mostly organisational, financial, legal, social and technical.The use of joint contracting of mutualised energy services is a promising model for industrial parks, especially when businesses are not energy intensive and when they don't have the time, expertise and financial resources to develop such energy cooperation. In that sense, energy services companies have a role to play in providing businesses with high-value services in the form of e.g. heating, electricity, cooling, to master a modern, environmentally friendly, renewable based and energy efficient system in industrial parks relying on the latest technologies and solutions (e.g. highly efficient, renewable and waste/residual recovery based systems, demand response, energy cascades).Proposals should improve the energy efficiency of industrial parks (or neighbouring businesses) by unlocking the market potential for energy cooperation and by supporting the demand and offer of mutualised high-quality energy services.Proposals should address at least one of the following aspects:Proposals should address legal issues in order to adapt regulatory and legal frameworks at the local, regional and national context. Proposals should also have a cross-cutting perspective and a strong communication and dissemination component to reach as many industries, industrial parks manager and ESCOs as possible and to break the industrial cultural perception of mutualised energy services and energy cooperation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Following the increasing demand for cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, dematerialization of documents and other ICT services, the demand for ICT processing is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. Data centres should become more energy efficient and should maximise integration of renewable energy sources. Intermittent renewable energy sources need to be combined with energy storage (electricity or cold/heat) to ensure efficient and secure energy management in data centres. In addition, existing and new data centres should be better integrated into the various energy grids (electricity and/or heat) in order to turn their energy use and waste into a benefit for the whole energy system. Previous research activities in this area have identified a wide array of innovative solutions and concepts. However, further research and development activities are needed to bring them to the market. Speeding up the time-to-market of these promising solutions is the main challenge under this topic.Innovation Actions are needed to increase the energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and integration of data centres in the energy system. Proposals should cover several following areas: innovative and energy efficient cooling solutions, waste heat reuse, geographical and temporal workload balance, integration of local and remote renewable energy sources, integration in smart grids, integration with district heating/cooling networks, integration of power backup system in the grid and use of heat pumps for efficient use of waste heat etc. Proposals should include the development of business models to trade heat, cold, electricity or energy security and storage.

"""The challenge for the European industry is to develop a global technological leadership in energy efficiency solutions. The EU-funding alone will not be sufficient to ensure an increase in energy efficiency in the process industry by 20% in 2020 and to radically reduce the energy content of production, leading to more flexible, less costly manufacturing processes and for self-consumption. Therefore the Member States and Associated Countries are invited through this action to identify Joint Actions in this field, to implement joint activities, and to systemically address the non-technology barriers for wider uptake of energy efficiency.The proposed ERA-NET action aims at development and launch of a joint call for proposals in the field of energy efficiency in Industry and Services. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. The joint call should focus around a limited number of industrial sectors, not covered under SPIRE. The projects financed by the joint call should cover either industrial sectors with very energy intensive industrial processes or industrial sectors with large energy consumption due to their market presence, though their industrial processes are not highly energy intensive. Further, they should cover industrial sectors with innovative potential and willingness/readiness to implement energy efficiency measures at a meaningful scale. Finally, the size of the addressed industrial sectors in EU and/or their benefits for the EU economy need to be taken into account. The joint call should address Innovation Actions and include the elements related to persistent market barriers. Proposals should demonstrate how the proposed activities will be continued commercially beyond the project lifetime. Involvement of relevant multiplier organisations is encouraged. The ERA-NET action will be implemented according to the three reporting periods scheme.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.The ERA-NET action will indicate the specific impact resulting from the transnational nature of the action and the European added value. Deliverables of each of the projects financed by the joint call will be included in the reports of the ERA-NET action to the European Commission. The projects financed by the joint call are expected to demonstrate the impacts in terms of primary energy savings triggered by the project within its duration (in GWh/year per million Euro of EU funding). They are also expected to contribute to the objectives of the EU Energy Efficiency policies and initiatives.

"""Innovation is fostered when new ideas can emerge and easily translate into socio-economic value. Working together, partners with complementary backgrounds, knowledge and skills, and in new and established value-chains, can turn these ideas into sustainable innovative products, processes and services that both address societal challenges and/or are highly competitive in global markets. FTI aims to accelerate this commercialisation process by providing extended funding opportunities through an open and agile scheme nurturing bottom-up ideas from innovative constituencies across Europe.The FTI pilot supports projects undertaking innovation from the demonstration stage through to market uptake, including stages such as piloting, test-beds, systems validation in real world/working conditions, validation of business models, pre-normative research, and standard-setting. It targets relatively mature new technologies, concepts, processes and business models that need a last development step to reach the market and achieve wider deployment. To this end, if a proposal involves technological innovation, the consortium must declare that the technology or the technologies concerned are at least at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, where appropriate [1] . Projects can be interdisciplinary.Proposals must relate to any field under the specific objective ""Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies"" and/or to any of the specific objectives under the priority ""Societal challenges""[2].Proposals should specify the intended outcome of the project and describe its key performance indicators/success criteria.Proposals must also include a business plan clearly describing the market potential (potential users/customers and benefits for them; targeted European/global markets, etc.), the business opportunities for participants, measures to enhance the probability of eventual commercial take-up and a credible commercialisation strategy that identifies next steps and specifies other actors to be involved. Particular attention should be paid to IP protection and ownership and to the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').The expected impact should be clearly described in both qualitative and quantitative terms.

The solutions proposed will support modern system architectures possibly including those based on heterogeneous processors while allowing for optimization of energy, performance, reliability, time predictability and system cost. All the activities needed in software development should be addressed when relevant; e.g.: remote collaboration, debugging and bug tracking, runtime software analysis. Model-based approaches and reuse and extension of existing platforms, libraries, frameworks and tools are encouraged, resulting ideally in complete solutions which are practically usable for application development for real-world use cases.Security by design features allowing applications to be resilient to cyber-attacks are encouraged to be part of the proposed technology, as well as features for energy-aware solutions and for tolerating hardware and software errors while guaranteeing the required service level.Solutions will be demonstrated in real-life applications through at least two different use cases complementing each other, and will provide significant and measurable improvements over state-of-the-art methods and technologies in productivity, software quality and energy consumption.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.b. Coordination and Support Activities for structuring and connecting the European academic and industrial research and innovation communities.

"""Recent trends in cloud computing go towards the development of new paradigms (heterogeneous, federated, distributed clouds) as opposed to the current centralised model, with tight interactions between the computing and networking infrastructures. The challenge is to address, from the research and experimentation perspectives, the necessary evolution in cloud architectures, cloud networking, deployment practices and run-time management as well as the associated security and privacy needs. The ambition is to increase the uptake of cloud technology by providing the robustness, trustworthiness, and performance required for applications currently considered too critical to be deployed on existing clouds. From the innovation side, the challenge is in fostering the provision and adoption of competitive, innovative, secure and reliable cloud computing services by SMEs and public sector organisations across Europe.

"""This challenge frames the 5G PPP initiative, whose phase 2 will be implemented under this LEIT-ICT Work Programme. The challenge is to eliminate the current and anticipated limitations of network infrastructures, by making them capable of supporting a much wider array of requirement than is the case today and with capability of flexibly adapting to different ""vertical"" application requirements. The vision is that in ten years from now, telecom and IT will be integrated in a common very high capacity and flexible 5G ubiquitous infrastructure, with seamless integration of heterogeneous wired and wireless capabilities. 5G Networks have to cover a wide range of services from different use case and application areas/verticals, for increasingly capable user terminals, and for an extremely diverse set of connected machines and things; to cope with an increasingly cloud-based service access (>90% of the internet traffic will go through data centres); to support a shift from the “Client-Server” model to “Anything” as a Service (XaaS), without needs of owning hardware, software or the cognitive objects themselves. Network elements will become ""computing equivalent"" elements that gather programmable resources, interfaces and functions based on virtualisation technologies, to implement control functionalities ad-how as a function of the use case.This challenge includes optimisation of cost functions (capex/opex) and of scarce resources (e.g. energy, spectrum), as well as migration towards new network architectures.A particular issue is to leverage work and results of phase 1 (WP 2014-15)[1] and to accelerate on proof of concepts and demonstrators. Where technological maturity permits, validation of research results, of the most demanding KPI's and of the most promising 5G technology options will be supported by experimental testing conducted in the context of use case in active cooperation with the various potential ""vertical"" sectors driving the innovative requirements. This validation activity is also expected to be boldly leveraged in the context of the important standardisation (3G PP) and spectrum (WRC 19) milestones that will appear over this WP implementation period.a. Research and Innovation Actions covers three strands that complement each other. Proposal may address parts of a strand or parts that cut across several strands.Strand 1 covers wireless access and radio network architecture/technologies:Strand 2: High capacity elastic - optical networksThe objective is to support very high traffic and capacity increase originating from an (5G) heterogeneous access networks with matching capabilities from the core and metro environments, at ever increasing speeds and in more flexible and adaptive form. It covers new spectrally efficient, adaptive transmission, networking, control and management approaches to increase network capacity by a factor of >100 while at the same time providing high service granularity, guarantees for end-to-end optimization and QoS - reducing power consumption, footprint and cost per bit and maintaining reach. The integration of such new optical transport and transmission designs with novel network control and management paradigms (e.g., SDN) are expected to enable programmability.Disruptive approaches for a massive capacity scaling may impact network infrastructure, and system architectures which need to be assessed for integration and migration aspects.Strand 3 covers the ""Software Network"", including work on:For the 3 strands above, projects will be implemented as a programme and be expected to actively contribute key horizontal results to the integration process led by the programme level CSA.

"""Network and service providers are faced with increasing challenges to manage convergence technologies. On the one hand, technological versatility increases service provision capabilities, with ever raising possibilities to dimension service offer to context and user specific SLA's. On the other hand, convergence technologies are getting increasingly complex, with ever larger integration of multiple technological heterogeneous hardware and software components, and more difficult properties to characterise at scale. The challenge thus tackles scalability and usability of mixed network technological approaches that can benefit from previous research, towards validation of deployment at scale.a. Innovation actions Strand 1: Ubiquitous 5G access leveraging optical technologies5G access networks have to dramatically grow in user capacity, quality of service, responsiveness, energy efficiency and number of connected devices while keeping a sustainable cost.The objective is to develop and assess new optical access network solutions based on integrated optical device prototypes. Novel integrated devices and subsystems may cover new optical transmission, switching and information processing techniques to support key access functionalities such as beam forming, high accuracy cm/mmWave generation and massive MIMO deployments. They may also be based on new network concepts and control architectures. Co-operative radio-optical approaches are seen as very promising, also to cover intelligent interference cancellation. Techniques to map 5G channels to optical transport and a co-design of the optical and wireless interfaces and protocols are also targeted, to increase capacity and reduce latency, especially in highly dense 5G scenarios. The work draws on existing scientific and research results in the field and includes scalable demonstrators validated through typical usage scenario.Strand 2: Flexible network applicationsThe work leverages the current intense research activities in relation to Virtualised Network Functions (VNF) and targets development of a multiplicity of VNF's useful to operators, service providers and users. Service providers or third party providers should be able to assemble these virtualised 5G functions as ""network apps"" from an NFV hosting infrastructure, to deploy them in the relevant network nodes, to orchestrate and customise resources to provision user services. The target is for a cloud like 5G infrastructures, supporting network services, resource and service orchestration. This environment also provides an open source development framework for control functionalities and application developments. It also provides the link between the network –terminal functions and the app/content providers towards standards developments.

"""Today the net is a place unlocking rapid innovation. This potential is too often left un-exploited, i.e. Europe does not do enough to turn RTD & I outcomes into business success. In particular open platforms offer opportunities for the development of new services and applications. FIWARE, for example, is an open platform that demonstrates the capacity to become a preferred service platform, but its potential is currently underused.Current centralised platforms for big and social data management consolidate the dominance of existing incumbent actors, stifling innovation and allowing less and less control over the data by citizens. Distributed architectures and decentralised platforms have a huge potential to enable the creation of viable alternatives to current dominant models.More generally, key players and ecosystems, startups and SMEs often do not have sufficiently innovative technology in their hands to innovate on the net.

"""RAS operate through the integration of a wide range of different technologies, as noted above. In addition to the contribution of each of these technologies, it is also important to characterise the overall performance of an RAS in terms of its ability to perform system functions which traverse specific technological capabilities. The specific challenge here is to increase the system ability levels in terms of configurability, adaptability, motion, manipulation, decisional autonomy, dependability, interaction, perception and cognitive ability. Such system abilities provide a basis for setting performance metrics and for specifying desired levels of system performance. Reaching higher ability levels than currently available allows to advance the state of the art and to set future targets for robotic systems. Multiple-actor systems are composed of many actors who are able to operate independently but together can perform system functions. These actors may be autonomous entities, people, or static systems, including embedded sensor networks and cloud services, working together in the operational environment. The challenge is to develop complete, robust systems through the interaction of these many actors to carry out the system function.Integrated sets of common tool chains and real-world test installations are increasingly needed to support the development of complex robotics systems. The challenge resides in the need for open development and dissemination of common development tools and the provision of wide access to realistic testing environments for the end user community, especially SMEs. Robot testing and innovation facilities are starting to emerge in Europe but are underdeveloped in terms of their infrastructure and the facilities they offer. a.

The system operates through the interaction of diverse independent actors and needs to be robust against errors or the inaction of any specific actor. Proposed multiple-actor systems are expected to demonstrate autonomy over an extended time scale and clearly identify service level gains (compared with current systems) in the application area chosen by the proposal. Systems must be built around identified end user needs and performance should be measured using relevant end user metrics.The Commission considers that Multiple-actor proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 7 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one action will be supported within multiple-actor systems.c.

Proposals will build on an installation supported through existing EU, regional, national or commercial funding to develop a European accessible facility prioritised against emerging market domains and application areas. In order to ensure real-world conditions, these pilot installations will be based on existing infrastructures such as farms, hospitals / care homes, mines, nuclear sites, undersea sites, collapsed buildings etc. The proposed access mechanisms and infrastructure should provide a low access threshold for SMEs, public bodies and research organisations.Proposals are expected to provide a support infrastructure including as a minimum: instrumentation of the site; simulation support to allow off-site testing; access to the end user and local site experts, and metrics relating to the functional goals of the end user. The proposal should also address safety certification processes, the development of appropriate performance evaluation measures and application-specific benchmarks. The proposal should identify application-relevant standards and, where relevant, the types of human interaction expected, including the level of social interaction.Where appropriate, proposals should consider providing sharable standard platforms (hardware and software) to allow organisations offering individual modules or technologies to access the site, rather than limiting access to groups able to deliver whole systems.Proposals should clearly show how they will assess and, where appropriate, disseminate the results and market impact from trials carried out on the installation.

"""Technology capabilities alone are not sufficient to enable future markets development.

Benchmarking processes that provide consistency and value to the process of technology validation are lacking currently. Developing benchmarks that can be applied across multiple domains or areas of application allowing technical comparison is a priority.A further underlying need for the robotics community at large is to ensure the safety and security of their developments. Viable safety certification standards and processes (including testing protocols) are critical to the widespread deployment of robotic systems, but are not yet generally available. Such certification processes should cut across different domains and areas of application and need to be developed on a pan-European basis, but with global impact.Also the take up of robotics systems by public authorities is a challenge, as there are few if any generalised schemes for public procurement.

"""The global robotics market will change shape significantly in the next few years. As the deployment of robotics technology increases, it is necessary to ensure that robotics actions are flanked by specific measures to optimise market take-up of European research whilst the window is still open.There are several challenges including the lack of sustained exchanges about robotics between members of the widespread European stakeholders' community and of coordinated European effort towards global standardisation and regulation. There is also a lack of systematic foresight of developing trends and issues to inform strategy-makers and the robotics community e.g. as relating to a pro-active approach of ethical, legal and socio-economic (ELSE) issues. Understanding and responding to developments in these areas will require engagement with non-robotics experts able to analyse impact within their area of expertise. Robotics-specific strategy can then be developed from this analysis and used to shape the processes of design, development and deployment of market services and applications.It is also important to disseminate information not only to the robotics community but also externally to those users and organisations impacted by robotics technology. Furthermore it is important to identify and assess socio-economic weaknesses and threats in the European robotics landscape. These will change over time and long term monitoring actions will be critical to the development of a responsive strategy.Potential issues range from the development of supportive and effective regulatory environments to assessing the public perception of robotics and its socio-economic impact, as well as the underlying imaginaries (e.g. pre-conceptions helping to envisage the future) of robotics developers. Broader technology impact issues such as data privacy, legal rights, liability, responsible innovation and ethical issues concerning vulnerable sections of society will also need to be addressed.An intense user-engagement in the developments of robots designed to perform social tasks, and a wide public debate around the issues and concerns that these developments may raise are key conditions to ensure a societal and socio-economic uptake of robotic technology in an informed way and to enhance market and community development.Competitions on smart robotics can also play an important role in increasing the levels of public understanding, as well as helping to accelerate progress in a stimulating way.Coordination and Support Actions focusing on one or more of the following topic areas and taking into account ongoing actions:a. Non-technical barriers to robotics take-up:b. Standards and Regulation:c. Community support and outreach:d.

"""Europe's photonics industry is facing fierce global market competition and has to cope with a very high speed of technological developments in the field. Further major S&T progress and research and innovation investments are required for sustaining Europe's industrial competitiveness and leadership in photonic market sectors where Europe is strong (e.g. in laser-based manufacturing, medical photonics, sensing, lighting) and to exploit new emerging market opportunities.Moreover, Europe is experiencing the existence of many fragmented and rather uncoordinated developments between many different national and regional players. Europe suffers also from a slow innovation process for turning many good R&D results into innovative products (‘Valley of Death’). This requires a joined-up approach, covering missing links in the value chain, such as assembly and packaging of photonics components. Finally, Europe needs to better exploit the large enabling potential of photonics in many industrial sectors and in solutions addressing major societal challenges such as health and well-being, energy efficiency or safety.

"""In Europe too many promising high tech start-ups or innovative SMEs do not manage to grow and scale up at pan-European or international level. The tendency is that they either remain within a restricted national market or, if they manage to emerge, are often bought while they are still too small, thus failing to become full actors on the international scene and to create a sound ecosystem around their success. Beyond this, turning research results with high innovation potential into viable products and services, bringing them to the market at European or even global level remains a big challenge.Leveraging the Startup Europe[1] and Innovation Radar[2] initiatives, actions within this topic should on the one hand help established startups and prospective tech entrepreneurs to achieve market success and, on the other, raise broader awareness of high potential innovators in Europe with specific targeted actions for maturing innovation excellence in EU-funded ICT projects.

"""ECB and FP7 impact studies point out that the biggest challenge faced by innovative companies in Europe is not to find funding for R&I but to find a first customer. The challenge is to facilitate access of innovative companies to the market by removing barriers to Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) and Public Procurement of Innovative solutions (PPI) in Europe. Cross-border cooperation among procurers and defragmentation of public demand are key in this respect as potential market size is the most important decision factor for firms to participate or not in a public procurement. Speeding up of implementation cycles and further networking of national innovation procurement competence centres are also needed.Coordination and Support actionsProposals should focus on one of the two themes below:a. The objective is to support the creation of European wide networks of procurers (European Public Procurers networks) that define together an innovation procurement roadmap, identifying shared procurement needs in the near term (relevant for PPI) as well as mid-to-long term (relevant for PCP) in areas of common European interest.European Public Procurers (EPP) networks are expected to engage into an open dialogue with all potential stakeholders, including other procurers and end-users. EPP networks are encouraged to publish their perceived procurement needs online, in a way that enables the research and innovation community to comment and submit ideas to make suggestions for future PCPs or PPIs.. EPP networks should also undertake activities that investigate the feasibility and facilitate the concrete preparation of a cross-border PCP or PPI for at least one shared common procurement need.EPP networks should contain a critical mass of public procurers responsible for the acquisition and/or regulatory strategy for innovative solutions in areas of public interest that are large potential customers for ICT LEIT technologies. EPP networks should also undertake dissemination activities to share results and raise awareness about PCP and PPI across Europe.b. The objective is to support the creation of one EU wide network of national competence centers on innovation procurement (PCP and PPI). Activities undertaken by the network are expected to include the creation of new national innovation competence centers and the enlarging of the scope of existing competence centers. They should also include experience sharing on PCP/PPI implementation across Europe, promoting Horizon 2020 funding and synergies with ESIF funding for PCP and PPI to ICT procurers in cooperation with NCPs, assisting ICT procurers in starting up such procurements nationally and collaborating cross-border to facilitate also transnational joint procurement.In cooperation with policy makers, the network should also develop and coordinate policy actions to mainstream PCP and PPI across Europe such as setting targets and developing financial incentive schemes for procurers to undertake PCP and PPI.The network is expected to maximize synergies with national and ESIF funding and focus the budget requested from Horizon 2020 on activities/partners that cannot be funded from ESIF or for which national funding is not available.The expected duration for the action is 4 years. The minimum participation is 5 existing national innovation procurement competence centers plus 5 public bodies that have the mandate to setup 5 new innovation procurement competence centers (in total from 10 different Member States or associated countries), aiming for EU wide participation of innovation procurement centers in the network by the end of the project.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow these themes to be addressed appropriately.

"""The development and deployment of digital technologies and services induces pervasive and radical changes in our lives and in the societal system. The explosion of the number of devices, their increased ""intelligence"", autonomous behavior and connectivity are changing significantly the life conditions of Europeans. Beyond the benefits brought about by technological innovations, there are also challenges, and sometimes threats, that need to be addressed to ensure that technological innovations go hand in hand with societal needs and expectations. Including SSH (social sciences and humanities) expertise provides a constructive and critical accompaniment of the scientific and technological developments for the projects funded under LEIT-ICT, and enables responsible research and innovation in the digital age.SSH engagement in ICT research can both address proactively the impacts of the take-up of novel technologies, and contribute to innovation by proposing alternative approaches. For example, considering that there is a trade-off between privacy and security refers to conceptions that can be challenged. Reconsidering underlying assumptions or taking a new and broader view to ICT related research and innovation can lead to other options that inspire different and more responsible technological R&I, with new benefits for the society.  a. Research and Innovation Actions should take a fresh look on the relationship between information and communication technologies, on the one hand, and social phenomena, on the other hand. They should contribute to ongoing ICT-driven research and innovation by providing best practice in collaborative research between SSH and ICT communities. The projects are expected to have direct relevance to ongoing ICT-related research and innovation, in particular in the area of robotics, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, big data and cybersecurity.From this wide range of issues, proposals are expected to focus on one or both of the following clusters:The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately.

Smaller short-term Research and Innovation Actions are expected to engage SSH expertise and, potentially other actors, to reflect and challenge the way ICT-related research and innovation is currently approached in a specific area and/or reflected in the call text. This approach opens new ways for interactions between SSH and ICT. SSH expertise is called for to unveil and challenge the implicit assumptions underlying broader technological research agendas, with a view to propose constructive alternative framings which enhance considerations for responsible ICT research and innovation. These so called ""sister projects"" should clearly describe how they intend to bring an innovative research perspective for one or more LEIT ICT topic areas. These projects are expected to have a light project structure, accommodating for its exploratory experimental nature and its relevance beyond disciplinary boundaries.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 300.000 and 500.000 and running for 12 months would allow this area to be addressed appropriately.

"""Increasing urbanisation and the transformation of rural economies and communities result in new types of rural-urban interaction and dependency, to which policies and governance approaches still have to fully adapt. Consolidated evidence is needed to assess the impact of such interaction on rural growth potential (in which there is an increasing interest worldwide) and understand, in concrete and operational terms, how linkages and dependencies between urban and rural activities affect the creation of added value and jobs. Recent studies have provided some evidence that well-functioning relationships between urban and rural areas can lead to higher growth rates in both. They may also deliver more sustainable, integrated and inclusive forms of development, building on local assets and natural resources to improve adaptation and resilience to global change. There is a need for thorough understanding and a consolidated conceptual framework is needed to tailor policy intervention at different scales so as to maximise rural job and growth creation on the basis of synergistic interaction.Building on the EU typology of urban and rural areas[1] and on the outcomes of previous studies on rural-urban linkages, proposals should consolidate a conceptual and policy framework adapted to the diversity of European needs, including a well-argued approach to defining functional areas. They should analyse how European rural areas interact with other (in particular, urban) areas in their region or beyond, exploring endogenous conditions that enable them to interact and quantifying the importance of these connections for the rural economy and society. Activities should involve case studies covering a diverse set of territorial contexts and scales of analysis describing practical linkages between rural and urban activities, mutual dependencies, competitive or synergistic relationships, the distribution of value-adding production steps between rural and urban areas and the institutional and policy context. Proposals should involve participatory research identifying concrete opportunities for greater synergies and cooperation between urban and rural activities and communities, bottlenecks impeding synergistic development and concrete solutions to remove these bottlenecks. Activities should assess the effectiveness of a variety of existing or emerging governance approaches and instruments, including those provided by the European structural and investment funds, looking at official authorities but also at informal governance groups (e.g. local action groups). Concrete outputs could be a set of governance models and tools adapted to different types of situation. Such models should cater for better economic development as well as for modernisation of service delivery.Activities should look at economic, environmental and social linkages and dependencies in an integrated way and examine various territorial settings, covering various forms of territorial interaction beyond city-hinterland relationships, including networks of small market towns and other types of more distant, cross-border or international interaction.Projects should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[2], involving local development or economic development bodies in rural and urban areas or representatives of both rural and urban economic players. Activities should involve engagement with government bodies at the appropriate scale, and with businesses and society. Targeted communication activities and easy-to-use policy-oriented outputs and training material will ensure maximum uptake of the results during the lifetime of the project and beyond.

"""At the interface of land and sea, coastal areas are environmentally fragile but also attractive areas with unexploited business opportunities. Land-based activities in coastal regions and even beyond, in upstream river-basins, influence the availability and quality of fresh water reaching the sea and, as a consequence, coastal and sea-based economic activities (including tourism) and the exploitation of marine resources. Equally, coastal development can have positive or negative effects on hinterland development, e.g. tourism-related pressure on land availability. Mainstream agro-environmental policies tend to fail when it comes to lowering nutrient load on the shorelines while rural economies do not always benefit from the economic development on the coast. There is a need to explore how territorial governance approaches and cross-sectoral economic development approaches could deliver mutually beneficial impacts for rural territories and coastal areas and seas which cannot be achieved in other ways, in particular as regards mitigating the impact of land-based activities on coastal water quality.Combining environmental, agricultural and socio-economic research, proposals will identify and analyse interactions between land (coast and hinterland) and sea, identify the various components of local economies at the interface of land and sea and analyse their respective importance and short, medium and long-term development trends taking into account market, environmental and climate forecasts. The analysis should provide an inventory of the positive and negative externalities of different activities, including the effect they have on each other, and consider whether solutions exist to mitigate negative externalities and enhance positive externalities, listing motivations and barriers to change for the types of player involved. The analysis should highlight potential cross-sectoral interactions and innovation that could emerge from greater cooperation between sea-based and land-based businesses or organisations.The analysis should cover a representative set of coastal areas or regions across Europe varying according to size and geographical, environmental, socio-economic, institutional and administrative conditions (regional, inter-regional, macro-region, cross-border). Interactive research approaches should be used to engage with local businesses and citizens and elaborate options for cooperation, networking and integrated governance seeking to enhance partnership. Activities could usefully build on a review of positive (and perhaps negative) examples from different areas, including innovative business models integrating land-based and sea-based production with simultaneous benefit for the local economy, local jobs and the environment both on the coast and in the hinterland. Proposals could seek to create long-lasting relationships within and between the case study areas benchmarked by the project in order to generate knowledge exchange.Concrete outputs would include a set of tools which could be used to foster synergistic relationships in different coastal areas of Europe, and concrete and operational governance models to be applied.

"""Agriculture is the biggest source of pesticides and nitrate pollution in European fresh waters[1]. The quality of drinking water, which matters a lot to EU citizens, and the level and cost of treatment prior to consumption depend greatly on the quality of the ground-water and surface-water used to produce it. This is partly why the Water Framework Directive (WFD), linked to the Drinking Water Directive, puts such emphasis on the protection of ground-water and surface-water resources[2]. The diffuse pollution of water sources from the pesticides and fertilisers used in farming systems has been addressed with varying degrees of success by current policy tools but clearly remains an obstacle to achieving the WFD objectives. Monitoring such pollution is also challenging because of the high number of registered pesticides, the cost of analyses and the need for samples to be taken during periods of application and use, and in various weather conditions. Additionally, the time dynamics of water resource systems entail a delay between action at the soil surface and reaction in the ground-water. Appropriate monitoring and decision-support tools are needed to help develop and implement governance models to preserve the quality of drinking water resources.Proposals will entail a variety of case studies identifying good practices in the field of drinking-water management involving improved farming systems and land-use management; these will cover a variety of pedo-climatic conditions, vulnerable zones with different types of farming systems, contrasting legal frameworks, larger and smaller water collection areas, including rural and urban areas and only rural areas with a focus on small water supplies, which face the biggest problems in the EU and globally. The effectiveness of various measures in mitigating diffuse agricultural pollution will be analysed. Work will include cost-efficiency analysis of mitigation measures and cost-benefit analysis for the society and the actors concerned of identified preventive and curative options for the delivery of high-quality drinking water.

"""Regional differences with respect to the forest management systems implemented and long production cycles characterise the forestry sector in the EU. Forests generally provide for a range of goods and services, some valued by existing markets (i.e. wood and non-wood products), others not. Of the latter, some are ""public goods"" (i.e. they are non-excludable (everyone benefits from them) and are not subject to consumption rivalry), such as carbon sequestration and landscape, while others are ""common-pool resources"" (i.e. they are non-excludable goods but subject to competition in use), such as recreation or water supply. The regulatory framework is divided into forest polices and forest-related policies (e.g. rural development, climate, biodiversity, and energy) which are not necessarily mutually reinforcing. The responsibility for forest policies ranges from EU level (monitoring, protection, land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) reporting, etc.) to Member State or federal state level (inventory, planning, management, etc.). If the policy or market fails – a recognised threat – the undesired outcome is suboptimal provision of ecosystem services. The sustainable provision of ecosystem services therefore requires policy coordination, and the use of novel policies, business models and mechanisms, while taking into account the production of wood and non-wood forest products. Several EU Member States, with the help of the European Commission, are currently mapping and assessing the state of forest (and other) ecosystems and their services in their respective national territories as part of the 'Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) exercise. There is now significant scope to capitalise on these efforts and for greater implementation of the knowledge they have generated in practice.Proposals should aim to develop novel public policies, business models and mechanisms to ""internalise"" the proven socio-economic value of forest ecosystem services (""externalities"") and contribute to their sustainable supply, with proper consideration given to the multifunctional role of EU forests. Proposals should consider the holistic basket of economic, socio-cultural, recreational and environmental services, from both the supply and demand side, and the trade-offs between them. They should aim to close the gap between academic work, associated policy recommendations, and practice on the ground, and help achieve public acceptability. The role of active forest management, which incurs reduced income and/or higher investment, needs to be emphasised. Specifically, there is a need to develop mechanisms for the payment of ecosystem services at the appropriate level of forest management and administration. The pilot testing of the proposed mechanisms, which may combine public policy tools with business models, is encouraged.

"""Improving the sustainability of European farming systems and facilitating their transition is a key objective of the Common Agricultural Policy and of Horizon 2020. Research and innovation activities should play a key role in efforts to move towards more sustainable and resilient production systems, but often this is undermined by the lack of efficient approaches to convince the farming community and demonstrate the validity of innovative knowledge. Best practices often remain tacit knowledge within local communities and are not spread across the EU territory or made known to researchers. Also, it is recognised that a farmer’s main source of information is other farmers, and their experience and opinions are often decisive.Demonstration and pilot farms have a major role to play in the application of scientific findings and the spreading of best practices and innovative farming approaches within the farming community. Efforts are needed to develop their potential and prepare for European connectivity. Condition for effective peer-to-peer learning is that the demonstration farm operates under the same conditions as average commercial farms, i.e. subject to normal regulatory constraints and using the alternative production systems or agricultural practices/technologies in the course of its normal commercial farming activity.Proposals should involve producing a geo-referenced inventory of existing demonstration farms, providing an analysis of the key elements of efficient demonstration techniques and exploring the potential of farmer-to-farmer learning. In a first step, activities should map open commercial farms that engage in demonstration activities in Europe and describe the mediation techniques they apply. This inventory should be organised around a list of sectoral themes (focusing on specific primary products, e.g. crops, livestock, etc.) and also non-sectorial/cross-cutting themes (e.g. specific farming systems, energy saving, supply chain initiatives, care farming, etc.).From this inventory of open farms, proposals shall take a broad range of cases with a geographical coverage representative of EU agricultural sectors, systems and territories. They will analyse the various types of demonstration farms and programmes that use a commercial farm setting, looking at what they do, how they do it, who plays what role, and what is the impact. Project activities should result in a better insight in approaches and policies to encourage effective demonstration activities, and add value in this respect to the European Innovation Partnership ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"", its networking activities (e.g. EIP Focus Groups) and its Operational Groups.To deepen understanding of effective demonstration activities, consortia will include a sufficient number of actors with practical experience of such activities, including, as a minimum, agricultural/forestry practitioners (demonstration farms) and intermediary persons/bodies organising or facilitating on-farm demonstrations. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] and may involve a wide range of actors, such as farmers/farmers' groups, advisors, innovation support services, researchers, social scientists, EIP Operational Groups[2], national/regional networks and enterprises or other supply chain actors where relevant.Proposals should provide input for and look for synergies with topic RUR-12-2017 to ensure that the inventory of demonstration farms and best demonstration practices resulting from this topic result in concrete thematic knowledge exchange activities across European sectors and systems under that topic. Projects should provide input to and liaise with the SCAR- AKIS Strategic Working Group.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million and a maximum period of 30 months would allow for this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Demonstration and pilot farms have a major role to play in peer-to-peer learning in the broader farming community and for the effective transfer of knowledge on practical farming approaches. They are also a perfect instrument for disseminating possible innovative approaches resulting from scientific work. In addition, demonstration on “real” farms allows actors to meet, network and exchange knowledge beyond the classical knowledge transfer activities. Existing demonstration farms or experimental farms in specific thematic areas need to be connected and networked within Europe so that they can do more with less. The financial crisis and the launch of the EIP ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability""(EIP-AGRI)[1] raised awareness of the fact that farming infrastructure for demonstration purposes is costly and that thematic expertise should be shared within Europe. Beyond demonstration, thematic farm networks could develop increased interaction between science and practice, e.g. by for discussing research outputs, capturing research needs from practice, and providing a base to develop interactive innovation projects[2] responding to the needs or opportunities of the farming community. Connecting existing open-farm initiatives at local level with a view to better coordination is expected to generate 'EU added value'.Projects should set up network activities between geo-referenced demonstration farms dealing with specific themes across Europe with a view to exploiting their potential to improve delivery of practice-oriented knowledge and enhance interactive activities. Projects should cover a wide range of themes to be chosen according to where most added value for the EU is to be expected, and should contribute to a more sustainable and resilient agriculture and forestry. The themes would cover both sectoral approaches (e.g. specific crops or livestock) and cross-sectoral themes, for instance specific farming systems, management of soils / nutrients / water / biodiversity / landscape / supply chains, resource efficiency, agro-ecology, precision farming, environmental/climate farming challenges, integrated pest management, animal welfare, effective, resilient and biosecure livestock systems, resilient cropping, energy production and management, speciality crops, biomass applications etc. As a minimum, 10 themes should be covered. Projects should organise knowledge exchange activities and provide for connection with, and structured output from, exemplary demonstration farms that appeals to the average farmer and can be shared across Europe, e.g. farm visits, visual material (photos, video etc), easy-to-read texts, etc. The project activities should ensure synergy and complementarity with the EIP-AGRI, by thematically showcasing and cross-fertilising innovative practices/methods, and by delivering related audio-visual material and practice abstracts in the common EIP-AGRI format for practitioners[3]. They should also seek to use and complement outputs from relevant European, national and regional projects or clusters around the chosen themes, e.g. Focus Groups[4], Operational Groups[5] and Thematic networks[6].The demonstration networks should develop linkages with advisors and their activities. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[7], involving a wide range of actors with practical experience, such as farmers/farmers' groups, advisors, innovation support services, researchers, Operational groups, EIP national/regional networks and enterprises, or other supply-chain actors where relevant. They should look for synergies with the inventory of demonstration farms and best demonstration approaches delivered under topic RUR-11-2016 and coordinate their strategy with the SCAR- AKIS Strategic Working Group. Activities and networks would extend for periods longer than four years where appropriately substantiated and organise synergies with activities and groups within the EIP-AGRI.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.This action should initiate structured networking activities between demonstration farms in a broad range of specific themes with a view to boosting innovation across Europe.

"""Transition towards more sustainable agriculture, forestry, food and bio-based value chains, equipped to face the challenges ahead, requires a renewal and strengthening of the technical and soft skills of all concerned. Along with ensuring delivery of peer-reviewed output from practice-oriented research, this will contribute to an efficient and interactive agricultural knowledge and innovation system (AKIS).In 2010, 71% of European farm managers were operating on the basis of practical experience only. Education levels vary greatly depending on country, farm manager's age and gender, or farm structures, and this can hamper innovation. As the proportion of farmers with secondary and tertiary education rises, education will play an increasing role in farmers' capacity to co-create and implement new techniques and practices, anticipate and adapt to legislative, policy, market and environmental changes, design innovative ways of marketing their products and take part in interactive innovation systems and networks. New production processes and new types of supply chain in the wood, food and bio-based industry sectors also create a business demand for new skills. On the science side, there may be a shortage of researchers and capacities in fields of science of crucial importance for sustainable agriculture which are under-developed or unattractive in Europe.While basic research remains necessary, a crucial challenge is also to remove bottlenecks to the delivery of practice-oriented research to end-users. Current research evaluation systems are based mainly on scientific publications and give little incentive, appreciation or reward to scientists willing to invest in practice-oriented research. Some front-runners are engaging in new ways of rating such research activities that deserve to be assessed, applied to agriculture and may be upscaled to a wider range of research providers and funding bodies.Proposals will involve the production of a challenge- and foresight-based inventory of skills that will be needed in agriculture, forestry and related value chains, covering primary producers, advisors, industry, businesses and scientists. Proposals will review how current science, education and training systems in a wide and varied range of EU Member States (and possibly third countries) cater for these needs, seeking to draft roadmaps for the improvement of curricula, learning methods and long-term interaction between education, science and economic players. Particular attention should be paid to soft (e.g. entrepreneurial, intermediation and communication) skills in particular for farmers, advisors and researchers, and technical skills related to new practices or processes and sustainability requirements in scientific fields of importance for the future. Needs should be differentiated in the light of the variety of farming systems, current trends in structural change, emerging business models in farming and subsequent value chains and geographical conditions. Proposals should analyse how education and training systems could improve, in particular by attracting more farmers and other players to engage in sufficient education and lifelong learning and by ensuring that these systems are fit for purpose and permanently updated. Piloting of new curricula and training methods in some of the participating institutions could be considered. The effectiveness of existing EU policy instruments on education and training in this area should also be assessed and improvements proposed. Proposals will take into account relevant EU initiatives to ensure potential synergies (e.g. Erasmus+, Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions, Knowledge and Innovation Community Food for Future, etc.).Furthermore, proposals should develop an operational system for encouraging and measuring performance and reviewing outputs of interactive innovation and practice-oriented research, with a view to improving their effective delivery and the uptake of best practices from the field. They should build on front-running initiatives and assess different options currently being tested in the EU or elsewhere (e.g. the EIP-AGRI common format). Activities should deliver practical methodologies and criteria for i) measuring performance of research providers and projects with regard to their outputs for practice; and ii) translating academic knowledge into practical knowledge easily understandable by end-users. To this end, proposals should develop a peer-review system for research outputs ready-made for delivery to farmers and foresters, exploring all components required to operate such a system.Proposals should build on the analysis to make further policy recommendations on how to develop education, training and science in the future. Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[1] and be highly participatory, involving specialised education bodies, farming/forestry sector representatives and advisors from the outset of project development to maximise bottom-up elaboration and final uptake of project results. It may be useful to involve authorities in charge of curriculum development and measuring research impact. Communication and dissemination activities should reach out far beyond the consortium to improve the uptake of research results.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 7 million allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""There is a need to analyse the role of advisors in the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS) and explore farmers' decision making processes.Advisors' short- and long-term influence on farm decisions, their impartiality and the way practical knowledge is kept public and conserved in the longer term are determined by how various types of advisor are embedded in their national or regional AKIS, by how public and private advisory services interact, and by the type or combination of financing sources they use. This complex relationship is governed by public policies at national, regional and EU level and increasingly impacts on whether society can sufficiently move to more sustainable agricultural systems.While the term 'advice' normally refers to an 'opinion or recommendation offered as a guide to action' in a context of linear knowledge transfer from science to agricultural practice, the term 'advisor' appears to cover various and different roles. The role that authorities and private industry attribute to advisory services, and their expectations in terms of how this will help them fulfil their own objectives needs to be researched if we are to understand how AKIS really functions. New approaches need to be developed to enhance advisors' potential to boost innovation through their function as intermediaries connecting science and practice. The focus should be on the farmers' needs and behaviour, improving connections with research and finding ways of providing accurate and timely advice, including the use of new ICT advisory tools. The quality, efficiency and effectiveness of an advisory service rely on a relationship of trust over time between advisor and farmer and on the advisors' qualifications, experience and networking capacity. Therefore, the sustainable financing of specific basic functions of existing public/private advisors may be a key to success. The growing number and impact of private advisors and the shrinkage of public extension services makes cooperation between different types of advisors more challenging. New forms of interaction among advisors and between advisors and scientists need to be explored, in order to ultimately improve knowledge flows in Member States' AKIS and in the EU, and to conserve and develop public knowledge for agriculture.Considering the different types of farming systems and farmers, proposals should examine how farmers make their decisions and who influences them most. Within this context, activities should analyse the role of the various types of advisor in the AKISs. Taking into account the impact of face-to-face interaction, projects should identify the key factors in the creation of trust between farmer and advisor so as to enable effective knowledge transfer and exchange. They shall, as a minimum, explore the relationship between advisors and researchers and between advisors and farmers, identifying the main elements facilitating the flow of information in both directions. Apart from linear knowledge transfer processes, particular attention should be paid to advisors' potential to boost innovation, inter alia by funnelling practice needs into research activities, participating and intermediating in farmer-to-farmer learning processes and interactive innovation projects[1], and by acting as innovation brokers or as an innovation support service encouraging innovation projects and capturing grass-roots innovative ideas from practice for further development.Moreover, projects should examine which governance models are most appropriate for empowering such multi-functional advisory services: how can the various advisory roles be embedded in regional, national and EU AKIS policies, how can public and private advisors be interconnected (both at MS and at EU level), are they in competition or well-coordinated, how is the lifelong training of advisors organised (who, when, why etc), what are the minimum education requirements for an advisor, how to support farmer-to-farmer learning or organise knowledge building using ICT tools or the internet, etc.Proposals shall also explore the role of advisors in innovation networks at local, regional, national and European level (e.g. within the EU Farm Advisory System, the European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI) network, National Rural Networks, the European Network for Rural Development, Leader, etc.) and the role of farmers' associations (trade unions, cooperatives, irrigation associations, etc.) or private advisors linked to agricultural input suppliers.Activities should analyse the impact of funding for multi-functional advisory services under national policies and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in general, including the impact of public procurement for the selection of advisory services, possible difficulties for smaller advisory services wishing to participate, the requirement that advisors should follow regular training etc. Projectss shall identify best practices from a broad series of practical cases across the EU. They fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach[2]'. Consortia must include a range of key actors with practical experience in the subject such as private and public advisors and advisory services, and also other relevant players such as farmers, farmers' organisations, social scientists, researchers, authorities, businesses or cooperatives providing advice etc. The project should provide input to and liaise with the SCAR- AKIS Strategic Working Group.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.This action should contribute to understanding the future role of advisors in AKIS and their potential to boost innovation, and improve related public policies.

"""A number of recent initiatives and instruments for speeding up innovation deserve in-depth exploration. Horizon 2020 and the European Commission's Communication on the CAP towards 2020 have focused attention on innovation in agriculture and related sectors. The European Innovation Partnership (EIP) ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"", a new approach under the Europe 2020 strategy, aims to speed up EU research and innovation by linking existing policies, instruments and actors. The agricultural EIP in particular implements the interactive innovation approach which relies on knowledge exchange and the empowerment of all actors concerned, and focuses on getting results implemented in practice. An EU wide EIP network is connecting the EIP Operational Groups funded under rural development programmes and provides interaction with Horizon 2020 projects. Apart from Horizon 2020 multi-actor research projects and thematic networks compiling practice-ready knowledge, other EU and national policies may also contribute to innovation, e.g. the Farm Advisory System, Rural Development funding supporting farm advisory services, knowledge and information actions, LEADER, specific national/regional or particular H2020 instruments etc. All of these contribute to innovation in agriculture and forestry. The challenge is to improve their targeting and interlinking - if and where needed - , and possibly learn from relevant insights from outside Europe.Proposals should explore how instruments and approaches under the various policies could be further adjusted and how they contribute to innovation in the agricultural and forestry sector. Learning also from experience at international level, proposals should investigate the design and implementation of interactive innovation projects[1], on the basis of a substantial number of case studies of interactive projects in a broad range of agriculture and forestry sectors.An essential part of this topic would develop detailed best practices/approaches for H2020 multi-actor projects and thematic networks at project level. On the basis of a series of cases of existing multi-actor projects and thematic networks, proposals should develop best practices for consortia to combine as much as possible both scientific and practical knowledge in their projects and exploit them to the full. Special attention needs to be given to the role of facilitators that mediate between different types of actor and to the particular management/coordination needs of this type of project, with a view to intensifying knowledge exchange between actors. Examples of unsuccessful approaches where project implementation is not delivering as expected are also relevant: 'facts', 'feelings' and group dynamics should be taken into account. Activities should investigate how co-creation and co-ownership of project results can be improved and quantified/qualified in order to speed up the use of project results in practice. Activities will examine how practically/legally to construct consortia with different types of actor, taking into account the different status of the various types of organisations involved (partner, subcontractor, etc). Projects should also explore pathways for involvement of secondary and higher education as actors in interactive innovation projects, including H2020 multi-actor projects, thematic networks and EIP Operational Groups. Furthermore, activities should examine how multi-actor projects and thematic networks can seek synergies and intensify effective linkages with Operational Groups and other interactive innovation projects under national/regional/European policies.Proposals should fall under the concept of the 'multi-actor approach'[2] involving key actors in the AKIS (farmers, advisors, researchers, research bodies, social scientists, managing authorities, network agents, enterprises, etc.) and using the work of the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group, as appropriate.

"""In a context of growing demand for resources and competition for land use, sustainably capturing the potential of seas and oceans is critical for the European Union. New markets, services and products will only arise from innovative, resource-efficient and integrated approaches which cut across economic sectors such as marine biomass integrated bio-refineries. Despite the large potential of products derived from algae, implementation is still limited mainly due to unfavourable economics. At present, microalgae are being applied in a limited volume (< 10 000 tonnes dry weight/year) in various niche markets (including food supplements) and macroalgae mass production is facing several challenges including the lack of space to further expand. To reach broader economic viability, costs of algal biomass production need to be reduced and the scale of production needs to be increased significantly. Even when the price of biomass production is reduced, algal biomass needs to be refined into multiple products in order to increase its total value and achieve economic feasibility. An integrated biorefinery concept of macro- or micro-algae and higher value bulk or speciality products can lead to economically feasible and environmentally sustainable processes. Thus, cost reductions in biomass production and harvesting in a sustainable way are essential for the further development and scale-up of the algal bioeconomy sector.Proposals should focus on demonstration projects that will scale-up the production and harvesting of integrated marine algae products and bring them nearer to the market in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable manner. Although the focus is on algae that grow in salt water, fresh water algae may be part of the work as well. The work should build on existing or new marine and maritime technologies. Proposals should address key challenges for scaling up integrated algae production systems, for example higher yielding algae species, optimised operation conditions and energy saving, limited contaminants, recycled nutrients and water, optimal CO2 use, storage and preservation of harvests before treatment, etc. Proposals should adopt a holistic, life-cycle approach and assess the broader environmental impact, for example from investigating the conditions for the access to sites, up to reducing the impact on the environment and improving education and skills in these sectors.

"""The interaction between people, oceans, seas and coasts is a broad domain with significant impacts on human health and well-being. However, it remains fragmented, poorly understood and underexploited. As coastal populations grow worldwide, not only due to permanent dwellers but also due to increasingly larger number of tourists, the determinants and impacts of this link between oceans and people become more relevant. On the one hand, the seas provide benefits namely through food, feed and positive impacts on overall wellness. On the other hand, the risks associated with the marine environment include chemical and physical pollutants of anthropogenic origin, harmful algal blooms, and countless marine microorganisms that lead to a still poorly assessed proportion of human morbidity and mortality.

Many solutions are available to tackle these sources of pollution, including recycling, waste water treatment, teams of collectors, and specific equipment such as skimmer boats, beach cleaning machines or algae harvesting devices. However, there is a pressing need to develop powerful innovative methods and processes to clean coasts and oceans and to restore the ecosystems to a healthy and clean state. The foremost challenge is not only to remove litter and pollution, but to transform the collected waste into a resource stream in line with the concept of the circular economy.The proposals should be for demonstration projects to clean and lay the ground for a healthy ocean or sea and its coasts in any given large geographic area(s), including regional seas or semi-closed sea basins such as the Mediterranean. The demonstration projects should develop and scale-up innovative processes and measures to clean the selected site[1] from visible (for example floating plastics or abandoned fishing gear) and invisible litter (micro-plastics) and pollutants[2], involving local communities and actors. Collected waste materials should be adequately processed so as to enable a subsequent usage/ exploitation/ re-usage. The proposals should apply an ecosystem approach, developing forecasting tools and models to identify areas where the proposed intervention is likely to be most effective in ecological and economic terms. Social acceptance and economic impact of the envisaged measures must also be considered and promoted, for example by disseminating the project results to relevant stakeholders.In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals addressing the Mediterranean should contribute to implement the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative).[3]The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.To contribute to the implementation of EU Policies such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and its aim to achieve a good environment status for Europe’s seas and oceans by 2020, proposals are expected to:[1]Each site should be substantial in size and include or be adjacent to different activities.[2]The exact selection of pollutants and litter will depend on the area selected. However, the choice of the area must be such that several sources of pollution are addressed.[3]The ""Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative)"" aims to advance a shared vision of a Mediterranean Sea that is healthy, productive, resilient, understood and valued so as to promote the well-being and prosperity of our citizens and future generations and boost socio economic growth and jobs.

"""The seafood[1] production and processing industry contributes substantially to food security, employment and trade in regions where the activity takes place. To safeguard and strengthen this and make the activity more sustainable, seafood production should be market-driven and consumer-responsive, addressing challenges such as increasing consumer awareness of food quality and safety traceability and animal welfare. Ensuring the sustainability of the seafood processing industry involves not only innovative technologies that could mitigate environmental damage but also securing its economic viability and taking account of the consumer imperatives behind them. One way of ensuring the sustainable production and processing of nutritious and safe seafood products is through the demonstration and first application in the market of eco-innovative, sustainable processing solutions of marine and aquaculture-derived food products and nutrients.Proposals should build on state-of-the-art research insights from EU and other funded projects in this field, with a specific focus on food safety (from harvesting to the final products). They should aim to generate new knowledge to develop commercial solutions for improving the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the seafood production and processing industry, while also contributing to product quality and safety. Activities should directly aim to produce plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, and large-scale product validation, all with a view to paving the way for subsequent market replication and uptake by consumers. Proposals may take into account impacts across different locations and population segments, as well as the specificities of different types of seafood, also in terms of nutrition. Work is expected to benefit from the contribution of social sciences wherever applicable. Where relevant, proposals should address gender-specific aspects, and the gender dimension in the research content shall be taken into account[2]. Aspects of traceability, authentication and certification of EU seafood products and labels of quality should be conveniently addressed.

"""The Arctic is a theatre of profound transformation. Climate change is significantly affecting the extent and thickness of sea-ice, on snow cover on ice-sheet melting, on permafrost thawing, and on marine and land ecosystems. These changes are bringing with them both risks and opportunities, and an integrated and multi-disciplinary Arctic observation system is becoming essential for studying, forecasting and assessing changes that support the region's sustainable development. Improving and coordinating current capabilities for assessing and predicting Arctic environmental change requires the provision of data on a number of key variables of Arctic meteorology, climatology, oceanography, ecosystems and pollution at various scales. Monitoring and improved understanding of the Arctic climate system and its teleconnections, as well as of ecosystem change and the socio-economic impacts on offshore operations, new shipping routes, mining activities, tourism etc. are important prerequisites for effectively assessing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the Arctic and elsewhere.An integrated Arctic observation system should close critical gaps with innovative solutions, as well as improve the integration and inter-operability of existing observation systems, also in view of data assimilation into models. The activity shall be based on co-operation between the existing European and international infrastructures (in-situ and remote including space-based) and the modelling communities, with the active participation of relevant stakeholder groups. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), the action should contribute to implementing the Transatlantic Ocean Research Alliance, the Sustaining Arctic Observation Networks (SAON) and the Cold Region Initiative of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). It should have links to the relevant Copernicus and European Space Agency (ESA) programmes and infrastructure in order to maximise the synergies other European efforts to develop an integrated Arctic observation system. In particular, strong coordination with the on-going Horizon 2020 project which aims to develop an Integrated Atlantic Ocean Observation System [1] should be sought and with the relevant ESFRI research infrastructures. The activity shall support and promote the integrated use of Arctic land, ocean, ice and atmosphere in-situ and space-based observations from Europe, the USA, Canada and other international partners. Community-based observation programmes that draw on indigenous and local knowledge should be included and should form the basis for participatory research and capacity-building within Arctic communities. The action should ensure data interoperability through internationally recognised standardisation and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) processes, promote database integration and allow free and open access to all data and data products, following the GEO data sharing principles. It should make best use of reference sites (supersites) and should contribute to filling in-situ observational gaps through novel technology development, with particular attention to the gaps that may help improve the accuracy of predictive models.

"""The climate is changing more rapidly in the Arctic than in any other region. There is evidence that these changes strongly affect ecosystems, people and communities inside and outside of the Arctic, including in Europe and North America. A better representation of processes specific to the Arctic (e.g. related to sea-ice formation and melting) in weather and climate models is required to better constrain the role of the Arctic in the global climate system and in the generation of extreme weather events. In connection with improved observations in the Arctic (see topic BG-09), this is necessary to improve the predictability of weather and climate in the Northern Hemisphere, and of related risks.Proposals should develop innovative approaches to improving the descriptions and modelling of the mechanisms, processes and feedback affecting Arctic climate change and its impacts on the weather and climate of the Northern Hemisphere, to further develop state-of-the-art climate models and predictions.

"""Arctic permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, stored in the upper metres of the ground. Thawing of permafrost may trigger the release of this carbon and its transformation to greenhouse gases, reinforcing global warming (permafrost carbon feedback). Moreover, permafrost coasts make up 34% of the world's coasts. Increasing sea-level in combination with changing sea-ice cover and permafrost thawing expose these coastal areas to higher risks. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the transfer of material - including organic matter - from land to sea and its fate, with the consequence that processes of accumulation and/or subsea permafrost degradation are not accounted for in global climate and Earth system models. The pressing challenge is to understand the impact of permafrost thawing on climate change and its implications for the environment, for the indigenous populations and the local communities. Finally, permafrost thawing affects the stability of built infrastructure.Actions should assess the impact of permafrost thawing on Arctic (natural and human) coastal systems and its effect on the availability/accessibility of resources, the stability of infrastructure, the growth of potential new economic activities, as well as on pollution and health.

"""The achievement of economic, environmental and societal sustainability of Blue Growth in the Mediterranean area requires that we understand and are able to forecast the evolution of the ecological, social and economic processes in the region. This must take into consideration the proper functioning of vulnerable marine ecosystems and sea-related economic sectors. In the Mediterranean region, several issues are specifically acute such as the vulnerability and poor resilience of ecosystems, the over-exploitation of seabed and biological resources, the severe pollution events and limited remediation actions, the drastic climate change effects, the frequent extreme events and geohazards, and the uneven protection of coastal infrastructures and populations. The EU is committed to supporting the development of solutions to solve the above mentioned issues through several policies and international agreements such as the EU Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the EU neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona convention and more recently the EU BLUEMED Initiative[1]. One of the main goals of the latter is to create an interoperable, fully integrated multiplatform observing and forecasting capacity to support the conservation of biodiversity, and to forecast and manage risks and emergencies at the coast and at sea. The implementation of these policies and conventions requires a strong knowledge base and predictive capacities that are derived from Earth observation data. These observation data are, however, still very fragmented, or are even lacking for certain areas of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular in the southern part. They are also still difficult to access, partly because of the many initiatives and systems that exist. The challenge here is to conduct the research and innovation activities that are necessary for the integration of the existing Earth observation facilities and networks in the Mediterranean Sea building on relevant initiatives such as Copernicus[2], GEOSS[3], GOOS[4], EMODNet[5], ESFRI[6] and in particular all those with strong links to marine and maritime issues, and national initiatives. This would fill out the existing observational gaps, and would help exploit the relevant data to build the necessary knowledge base and prediction capacities.The research and innovation activities to be included in the proposal should contribute to the development of an integrated observing system for the whole Mediterranean Sea building on existing facilities (remote sensing and in-situ) and initiatives, and addressing both the open sea and the coastal zone. This should be based on open data and should facilitate easy access to those facilities and the data. Another focus should be on conducting the research and innovation necessary to underpin the full and open discovery and access to the ocean observations and to facilitate the interoperable exchange of ocean observation as promoted through the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) for the Mediterranean Sea. The proposal should also address observational gaps in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular those related to the in-situ component of the observation system. Optimising existing systems and using new ocean observation technologies make in-situ ocean observation and the integration of the biological dimension into observing systems more cost-effective. The proposals should also focus on the use of in-situ measurements to calibrate and validate relevant remote sensing data and products, including possible new products derived from space infrastructures such as the Sentinel and Earth Explorer missions that support the improvement and evolution of operational services in the Mediterranean Sea. The above activities should include the participation of international partners from the coastal states of the Mediterranean Sea.In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative)[7].The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""The Mediterranean Sea is going through rapid changes in response to closely interlinked natural and anthropogenic pressures. Climate change influences its physical dynamics and hydrological structure, while nutrient and pollutant loads are flowing from growing urban areas, land and coastal activities. Increasing maritime traffic also leads to safety concerns, potential pollution and the introduction of invasive alien species. Fishing remains unsustainable. The area's marine heritage and its ecosystem services are also at risk. In addition, the geo-political complexity of the area adds further difficulties related to the establishment of favourable framework conditions to support the growth of a blue economy (e.g. in trans-border cooperation on sea-related activities, including maritime spatial planning). Within this frame, coordinated and integrated action needs to be carried out by Member States individually and among Member States together in order to create synergies and complementarities between sectors and countries. This is to provide added value to regional, national and EU investments, remove barriers, avoid duplication and reduce fragmentation, and was put forward in the Vision Statement of the 'Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area – The BLUEMED Initiative'[1].

This data gap hinders the development of economic models enabling the quantification of the bioeconomy and its economic, environmental and social effects.

"""Climate change and associated natural disturbances will increasingly influence the current distribution and productivity of tree species, within the constraints of physical barriers, long production cycles and regulations on forest reproductive materials. They will also affect the areas in which trees of different species and provenance could grow, or grow better, in the future. Assisted migration of tree species from one region (or continent) to another has contributed to increased wood production in Europe in recent centuries. Though there are examples of good practice and benefits of genetic variation, there is still limited evidence of the inherent genotypic/phenotypic plasticity of tree species and provenances, and their symbionts, to adapt rapidly enough and survive the current pace of environmental change. To counteract climate-induced decline and maintain/enhance forest productivity and meet the growing needs of society and the bioeconomy, we may enhance the resilience of forests through the selection/development of new genotypes, through traditional methods of genome sequencing and selection of desired traits and/or novel methods of genome improvement.Proposals should aim to develop novel tree breeding strategies and tools aimed at sustained yields (wood and non-wood products), while addressing resilience to climate change and natural disturbances (including pests and disease outbreaks), and considering biodiversity-related aspects.

"""Increasing societal demands and emerging policies relating to forest resources present new challenges for the sector and trigger the need to enhance the multi-functional role of forests in the EU. The quantity and the quality of wood yields depend on site conditions, forest management objectives, silvicultural regime and measures taken from the establishment of forest stands to the end of rotation (for even-aged forests) or the selection harvest (for uneven-aged forests). Managing forests' horizontal and vertical structure is crucially important given the long production cycles involved and the demand to adapt, within the production cycle, to the evolving framework of environmental and societal conditions. It is therefore desirable to develop intelligent (i.e. cost-efficient, productive and environment-friendly) and novel solutions and tools to support sustainable wood production from forests managed on a multifunctional basis.To add value to wood production and enable close-to-market outputs, proposals should aim to develop a series of cutting edge technologies in relation to forestry measures starting from seedling/replanting, through to harvesting.

Mobilisation of all actors along the value chain is crucial to mitigate the probability of ""technology mismatches"" (i.e. development of technologies without a corresponding reliable and cost-efficient feedstock supply, or which face insufficient market demand).The Mobilisation and Mutual Learning Action Plan (MML) should ensure the engagement of all relevant groups and tackle innovation related challenges by establishing a multi-stakeholder platform, gathering a plurality of actors with different perspectives, knowledge and experiences[1], and maintaining open dialogue between the different stakeholders.The objective of the platform should be the development and implementation of an Action Plan that would address the challenges of raising awareness of and engaging with the citizens on the bio-based products. Proposals have to be based on and develop the concept of Mobilisation & Mutual Learning Platforms (MML). The design of this platform and its activities should take into account and build on methods developed previously in European projects and initiatives (including consultation processes in the field of bio-based products).The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.The direct and sustainable impact of proposals will be: [1]Involving a balanced representation of experts and professionals in the fields of public engagement and bio-based products in general, and more specifically researchers, civil society (CSOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), scientists in the field of social sciences and humanities, industry and policy-makers.""","""theme"""
"""Regions may play a key role in the establishment of bio-based industries by providing a favourable business environment and the necessary political framework. Few regions in Europe are in the process of building successful ""bio-based industries"" demonstrator case studies.

"""The lack of access to skills, to latest knowledge and capacity to manage innovation processes effectively, have been identified as major barriers for innovation in SMEs. Individual SMEs are at a disadvantage to recruit specialised knowledge as they do not have the network Europe-wide and do not have as well-known brands as large enterprises. Enterprise-led mobility programmes, supporting enterprises in recruiting expertise, show a high level of satisfaction and return on investment. As this methodology is not currently used at European level, an enterprise-led approach is to be developed and tested through a pilot. This complements Marie Skłodowska Curie actions (MSCA) which focus on developing research careers, by providing additional work opportunities for experienced researchers in innovating SMEs.This SME-led pilot is an innovation capacity building action to provide at European level a grant to visionary[1] SMEs which have experienced difficulty in recruiting the relevant skills nationally. SMEs are supported to employ a highly-skilled experienced researcher e.g an 'associate' for one year from September 2017. With their associate, these SMEs will explore for one year the potential of their innovative idea and turn it into an innovation project.The action will consist of: SMEs will employ for 12 months an associate to identify the potential of their innovation idea and turn it, or not, into a research or innovation project and hopefully further employment.During these 12 months of employment, every associate is requested to participate in a core training programme on industrial innovation and business management[3]. Also during that period, SMEs get financial support to implement a training and development plan specifically for the associate, tailored to the needs of the associate and the enterprise to make the associate fully operational in the company.In line with the orientation of the action and with the aim to accelerate the integration of the associate in the company's staff, the following costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the grant: personnel costs of the associate and cost directly related to company's and the associates participation in the pilot action: in particular relocation costs of the associate, travel subsistence costs to the core training programme and costs, including travel and subsistence) for tailored training (as described in the personal development plan). Other costs like recruitment costs or travel costs to action specific workshops by the supervisor in the enterprise would have to be covered under indirect costs.It is intended to support up to 90 assignments from the indicative budget.The following criteria will have to be met by the associate: i) PhD holder, ii) an expertise in line with the job advertisement; iii) transnational mobility as defined in the mobility rule of the Marie Slodowska Curie Actions (MSCA). [4]The execution of the action will start on the starting date of the associates' employment, in September 2017 (exact date to be determined during the grant preparation phase). In case of non-execution, the Commission reserves the right to terminate the grant agreement according to article 50.3.1.l.ii of the General mono-beneficiary grant agreement for the Horizon 2020 programme.The associates are expected to be offered employment contracts or equivalent by the hosting SMEs. It is expected that the 'associate' will commit him/herself for a full-time position, for the full duration of the grant.To promote the pilot, innovating SMEs experiencing skills shortages will be contacted by the Enterprise Europe Network innovation consultants and assisted in formulating a vacancy notice to address the identified skills' shortages.An accompanying study[5] will evaluate the impact of the pilot action and the satisfaction levels of awarded SMEs and associates as well as of a sample of non-awarded SMEs.Demonstrate that[1]Vision: 'A statement about what the organisation wants to achieve in terms of innovation. The vision should set a direction and a challenge that can inspire persons to commit and work towards, be sufficiently ambitious and not constrained by the organisation's current abilities, provide a target against which progress can be measured.'

"""Foresight studies show that the massive integration of advanced manufacturing will displace in a few years many of the current traditional manufacturing processes. In particular, energy and resource-efficient and low carbon technologies and the circular economy will be key drivers of innovation in SMEs. To remain competitive, manufacturing SMEs will increasingly need to rely on advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production. These technologies enable the development of new production processes, but also improve the manufacturing of existing products by reducing production costs, the reliance on raw materials and the consumption of energy, while diminishing the adverse impacts on the environment by reducing the generation of waste and pollution.Currently, only one third of manufacturing companies in the EU has used advanced manufacturing technologies so far and plans to use them in the next year[1]. The challenge is to provide technology support to SMEs who lack resources and/or competences to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production.SMEs' access to technology services and facilities remains difficult in many regions of the EU (a recent inventory shows that two thirds of the technology infrastructures providing services to SMEs in the field of advanced manufacturing are located in only four Member States[2]). In this context, the High Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) recommended in its report of June 2015 to ensure pan-European access of manufacturing companies to ""premier-class"" technology infrastructures in the field of KETs. As a first step, the Commission has published an inventory of existing technology infrastructures in the EU capable of providing SMEs with technology services and facilities in the field of KETs[3].In order to ensure cross-border access of manufacturing SMEs to technology services and/or facilities enabling them to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production process, the action will consist of all the elements listed below: The technology infrastructures should have the capacity to deliver services such as prototyping, testing, pilot production, engineering, training as well as expertise and advice (in technology but also on the overall innovation process) in order to assist SMEs to integrate innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production processes. The service provided to the SME should be driven by its business needs and the implementation should be flexible and fast to cope with the pace of innovation and the SME requirements. The consortium will define capacity and quality criteria and the network should be open to all technology infrastructures able to deliver services in compliance with these criteria. Criteria for monitoring the quality and impact of the services provided to the SMEs should also be established.Proposals should outline how the network will develop a common coherent methodology to support SMEs in integrating innovative advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production into their production process, including how to reach out to SMEs across Europe. Proposers are encouraged to link to existing or emerging regional and national networks in the field of advanced manufacturing for clean production, in particular in the context of smart specialisation.The action is expected to include financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The third parties are expected to be SMEs willing to integrate cutting-edge advanced manufacturing technologies into their production process in an innovative way which requires the purchase of a technology service and/or access to specific technology facilities. The consortium will define the criteria for selecting the proposals submitted by the SMEs (such as expected substantial improvement of the environmental performance, innovativeness, expected significant competitive advantage) as well as the criteria for identifying the technology infrastructures capable of providing the necessary services to the SMEs. The consortium will also define the process to select the best offer from the technology infrastructures within the network to provide the required services at the best value for money for each proposal submitted by SMEs. Grants awarded to third parties shall be provided as a lump sum not exceeding EUR 60,000 and should not cover the full cost of the service provided to the SMEs.Proposals should cover advanced manufacturing technologies for clean production from a circular economy perspective. This can include advanced manufacturing technologies allowing reduced energy, materials and water consumption, reduced waste generation and emissions, the use and re-use of recovered and recycled materials, biomass and/or other renewable inputs, the making of modular products and easier disassembly and separation, as well as process control technologies.Proposers are encouraged to link with ongoing activities in relevant Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) such as the Sustainable Process Industry (SPIRE)[4] and the Factories of the Future (FoF)[5] and their stakeholders.Proposers are encouraged to liaise with the Enterprise Europe Network, and cluster organisations, in particular for dissemination activities and identification of the. manufacturing SMEs having a big potential and willingness to adopt innovative advanced manufacturing solutions for clean production.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4.9 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""Creating a higher societal impact from innovation support requires increasing its efficiency. In the recent past innovation support agencies recognised that successful innovation is not originating only from scientific research and technological development, but from new business models, the uptake of technologies, design and organisational changes. Furthermore 'internationalisation’ of business activities is seen as a case of business innovation in some countries.A better understanding of business innovation opportunities led to an even broader array of innovation support measures put in place for SMEs. But the question arose how to better identify and target those SMEs that can create highest impact from the specific support measures; and how to offer viable alternatives to those enterprises not yet ready to implement the most ambitious projects. Representatives from innovation agencies were describing this process of matching design and delivery of support schemes to the needs, potentials and ambition of their client SMEs as ‘segmentation of the client base’.Processes of value creation from innovation differ between industrial sectors. For example between capital intensive - but low-speed – innovation in the mining industry; the high speed innovation software development for example for gaming which is realised in networks; pharmaceutical industry with a dominant role of patents and industries with long and complex supply chains like automotive or aerospace.Many regions try to identify potential high-growth SMEs and orient their support towards realising their full growth potential, yet the methodologies to identify high potentials vary substantially and innovation support programmes put in place are hardly designed taking account of the economic fabric or of the smart specialisation priorities of the region. Instead often a standard portfolio of innovation support measures is put in place.The above describes three interwoven aspects of a challenge to segment the (SME-) clients of public innovation support in order to achieve a higher societal return from the investments into innovation support. The action shall contribute to documenting and analysing existing and potential new approaches to provide innovation support in a more effective and efficient way. Successfully segmenting 'innovating SMEs' – the clients of innovation agencies – is a key in that respect.To address the described gaps proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:Projects to be supported are encouraged to conduct specific communication activities targeting the relevant associations of regional development agencies and innovation support agencies.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.30 and 1.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

"""According to the OECD, the US and Japan dominate R&D stocks for technologies ready for uptake by industry. 40% and 28% of the R&D stock held in OECD countries are located in the US and Japan respectively. Korea further contributes a significant share as a result of an active technology development policy followed for decades.Technologies are however hardly accessible for European SMEs – while multinational companies face less challenges in this respect. Access to technologies overseas is hampered amongst others by a mismatch of institutions and methodologies for technologies transfer. The friction from differences in approaches to technology transfer becomes evident in the daily work of the Enterprise Europe Network in which overseas entities became members on a self-financing basis. These network partners adopt the network’s working methods but face the challenge that direct interaction is hampered by the geographic distance, as a result, real hand-on cooperation with overseas partners in the Enterprise Europe Network remain limited.A limited number of experimental projects between the network sector groups and overseas partners of the Enterprise Europe Network shall be supported by grants. The objective is to better capitalise the industrial R&D stock of overseas OECD countries in the context of sector groups of the Enterprise Europe Network in collaboration with clusters.

"""A number of current Generation II reactors should continue operating for a few decades and Generation III should still be in operation one century from now. The objective of this action is to complement, where needed, earlier investment in research regarding the safety and reliability of Generation II and III reactors, with particular attention to the new requirements of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive (Council Directive 2014/87/Euratom of 8 July 2014 amending the Directive 2009/71/Euratom establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations).Safety and reliability improvements are to be sought in a number of areas, with due consideration to the NUGENIA roadmap. The action should address the remaining technology gaps and encompass experiments as well as numerical simulations. It should focus on the integrity of structural components in ageing reactors, the knowledge basis for lifetime management of the reactor islands and the management of severe accidents. This can involve inter alia: probabilistic safety assessment, uncertainty analyses, the identification and understanding of deterioration mechanisms, the assessment of the need for and feasibility of retrofitted safety systems, the development of tools to establish safety cases for Long Term Operation, study of the prevention of hydrogen production, the improved modelling of reactor behaviour, the methodology of seismic risk assessment, the evaluation of accident-tolerant fuel, the improved assessment of fire risks and the safety demonstration of digital I&C equipment and their practical implementation. All aspects of meltdown, as a key issue of Generation-II and -III reactors, are also considered to be in scope. Results obtained as part of this action should be made public. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 1 to 5 will be ranked in a single ranking list.This action will help industrial stakeholders to develop efficient solutions in response to the new requirements of the amended Nuclear Safety Directive.

"""This action aims at addressing the difficulties encountered with maintaining and renewing an adequate number of well-educated and trained nuclear researchers and professionals, especially in view of expected high retirement and low renewal rates in countries with a strong nuclear tradition and of the growing need for further specialised training in emerging nuclear energy countries.Special attention is to be devoted to the further implementation, in the nuclear and relevant medical and industrial sectors, of initiatives to attract new talent in the nuclear field and develop competences and expertise beyond the academic curricula. This could be achieved through further proposals of 'Euratom Fission Training Schemes', based on ECTS and ECVET mechanisms and complemented by setting up a strong grant programme to support the participation of students in nuclear training programmes in the EU. These programmes would relate to nuclear technology, safety and radiation protection and address the integration of students and bright young researchers into Euratom-supported research projects. Proposals should cover periods between six months and two years. The aim is to respond to the needs of the nuclear industry, regulatory bodies and TSOs. Also important are the so-called nuclear activities of proximity, which include medical applications, the relevant non-nuclear industrial applications and the transport of radioactive materials. Links should be established with the 'European Nuclear Education Network' (ENEN) and the different Euratom fission science and technology platforms. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged and will be considered during the evaluation.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.This action will revive the interest of the young generation for careers in the nuclear sector (in particular, reactor safety, geological disposal, radiation protection).""","""theme"""
"""As the fusion programme progresses towards the ultimate goal of electricity generation, there are increasing opportunities for synergies in a wide range of areas that are common with fission. The present action is to encourage closer integration of research efforts between fission and fusion research communities in the domain of multi-scale modelling in research on material properties and the development of new materials.Ferritic-martensitic (F/M) steel is a promising material for use in both fusion and fission installations. Multi-scale modelling is expected to be an efficient and effective tool in the development of a complete description and in-depth understanding of phenomena in these steels. In this context, the predictive capability of models is of paramount importance and should be aimed at supporting the elaboration of design rules. Proposed modelling approaches would need to be supported by robust validation means, including where necessary testing of environmental degradation and appropriate irradiation campaigns ranging from neutrons to ions. Contributions to benchmarking, the development of codes and standards as well as to small specimen test technology is also encouraged. It is essential for proposals to demonstrate substantial benefit for both fission and fusion, to include actors from both communities (specifically EUROfusion and EERA Joint Programme on Nuclear Materials), and to complement the existing research efforts in both domains.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from Euratom of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Proposals for topics NFRP 13 and 14 will be ranked in a single ranking list.This action will help the cross-fertilisation in nuclear materials research between the two main fields of activity represented by fission and fusion and will result in a better general understanding and critical mass in the discipline as a whole. In turn, it will help overcome bottlenecks that are limiting developments in fission and fusion, including in technology areas with safety relevance.""","""theme"""
"""Tritium in the environment and its health impacts are a concern. Indeed, whilst discharges of most radionuclides from fission installations are decreasing, as a result of the use of new techniques of effluent decontamination, tritium discharges are increasing owing to new nuclear fuel management modes and the lack of detritiation capability. Discharges are also anticipated from fusion installations once they start operating as nuclear facilities. Further research is needed to assess and mitigate impacts of discharges and potentially to limit them.This action should assess technologies to minimise tritium permeation at source and to capture and store tritium from treatment of metallic waste and liquid and gaseous effluents, e.g. using photo-synthesised polymers. This action should also include (i) an assessment of the tritium inventory in both fission and fusion systems using state-of-the-art modelling tools for tritium migration studies, e.g. from primary to secondary systems between which tritium may pass, (ii) refinement of the knowledge on outgassing and release mechanisms, radiotoxicity, radioecology, radiobiology, dosimetry and metrology of tritium, (iii) engineering solutions for detritiation techniques (metals, liquids and gasses) and waste management to meet the stringent regulations in force in the EU, and (iv) tritium permeation control (anti-permeation techniques). It is essential for proposals to demonstrate substantial benefit for both fission and fusion, to include actors from both communities, and to complement the existing research efforts in both domains.

"""The first Generation-IV reactors are expected to be fully operational in the next 25-30 years in various places around the world. In the meantime, all Generation-IV concepts and designs currently under development, both in Europe and worldwide, will need to demonstrate compliance with evolving and ever more stringent safety requirements. In this context, a significant increase in the level of safety is expected to be demonstrated by fast neutron reactors and new reactor coolants. These should exhibit more favourable behaviour in the case of severe accidents, whilst also offering major advantages in terms of the use of the uranium resource, reduction of high-level waste production and potentially increased proliferation resistance. This activity will build on the strong operational experience gained in the EU on fast neutron reactors, whilst ensuring that research and technical expertise on nuclear safety of Generation-IV reactor is shared effectively at EU level. The challenge is also to ensure that all European stakeholders, including civil society, can be represented in the assessment of the status of current developments concerning Generation-IV R&D with respect to expected safety features.This action is aimed at development of the technical assessment of safety improvements of critical fast neutron Generation-IV systems and their supporting reactor islands, as identified by ESNII in the SET Plan Integrated Roadmap[1]. This can include inter alia the study of core parameter optimisation and reactivity control, reliability of automatic shut-down systems, diversified systems of residual power removal more resistant to common mode failure, demonstrable natural circulation of cooling fluids in ultimate heat transfer processes, improved strategy of confinement modes and severe accident behaviour and mitigation including their simulation, in-service inspection and repair of safety-related components, as well as the related licensing aspects. The safety of different fuel cycle options is within scope, including dense MOX driver fuel, multiple recycling of plutonium, use of low-enriched uranium and transmutation of some minor actinides, as is the design and operational features facilitating and improving safety of decommissioning. These safety improvements will need to be endorsed by the EU scientific community in view of building up the main corpus of EU technical standards for Generation-IV to be used as the reference to demonstrate compliance with the amended Euratom Safety Directive.

The EU benefits from extensive operational experience in this domain, which is unique in the world. This experience should be exploited and extended to further improve nuclear safety, radiation protection and environmental protection aspects of fuel reprocessing options. This challenge is also to be seen in relation to partitioning and transmutation processes for suitable recycling strategies, development and qualification, and safety assessment of innovative fuels and claddings for advanced Generation-IV systems.This action will address research and innovation in fuel cycle chemistry and physics for the optimisation of fuel design in line with the strategic research and innovation agenda and deployment strategy of SNETP, notably of its ESNII component.

This applies in particular to changes in properties of materials and joints under fast neutron irradiation and/or high temperature of the coolant, as well as to the compatibility between structural materials, the coolant and advanced fuels. This action should include the refinement of physical models and/or modelling-oriented experiments aimed at the validation of models of microstructural change and the resulting effects on material properties, as well as advanced micro-structural characterisation techniques.

"""The healthcare biotechnology sector offers huge business and commercial opportunities; however it also requires heavy and risky investments which are often lacking in Europe, hampering the development of the industry.The challenge includes either:a) Cell technologies in medical applications (all phase 1 and phase 2 deadlines in 2016 and 2017)Cell technologies include cell manufacturing (culture, multiplication, scale-up and automation), preservation, banking and transport; identification, cell sorting and delivery, imaging, tracking, process and quality control; genetic engineering and gene editing; production of therapeutic biomolecules. The medical applications of cell technologies include diagnostics and biosensors; cell and gene therapy, tissue engineering, bio-artificial organs, haematology, immunotherapy, and vaccine and antibody production; predictive toxicology, synthetic biology, and modelling development and disease processes.However, the diversity, complexity and variability of living cells pose challenges for bringing safe, reliable, regulatory-compliant and cost-effective products to the market and to the patient. SMEs developing cell-based products and processes have limited financial resources to take the critical steps to move from proof of concept to practical application while at the same time addressing considerations such as scale-up/scale-out, automation, logistics, regulatory pathways and business models.Particular attention should be given to dialogue with regulators and compliance with safety and regulatory requirements, such as those pertaining to cell procurement, GMP, ethics, clinical trials, ATMPs and medical devices.The challenge addresses cells from any eukaryotic source though their eventual application must be to human medicine.Or:b) Clinical research for the validation of biomarkers and/or diagnostic medical devices (only at the first cut-off date in 2017 and for phase 2 applications - phasing out of the topic PHC-12-2014/2015 introduced in the Work Programme 2014-2015)Biomarkers are used in clinical practice to indicate both normal and pathological conditions. They are also used for predictive or prognostic purposes. They are being used increasingly in medicine and many potential new biomarkers are proposed every year. However, only a few of these have been validated for clinical use. To achieve validation a robust analytical method is required and a link to a pertinent clinical process or endpoint needs to be demonstrated.This validation process should provide evidence for high analytical value, appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and clinical validity. Particular attention should be given to validation of biomarkers with potential for rapid uptake into clinical practice. Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Priority is given to the validation of disease-related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers). Validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can also be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation or against existing standards.The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.In phase 2, innovation projects[2]will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.SME instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.[1]This is not limited to the costs of acquiring and enforcing European or international IPR titles but could include auditing and risk management schemes to protect IP assets across planned supply and distribution chains and more generally IP valorisation plans to enhance return on investment and lever commercial investment into the relevant project.[2]In the case of SMEInst-05-2016-2017, research type activities in medical application and clinical validation, including support for clinical studies and trials, will be predominant and will necessitate reimbursement at 100%.

"""The healthcare biotechnology sector offers huge business and commercial opportunities; however it also requires heavy and risky investments which are often lacking in Europe, hampering the development of the industry.The challenge includes either:a) Cell technologies in medical applications (all phase 1 and phase 2 deadlines in 2016 and 2017)Cell technologies include cell manufacturing (culture, multiplication, scale-up and automation), preservation, banking and transport; identification, cell sorting and delivery, imaging, tracking, process and quality control; genetic engineering and gene editing; production of therapeutic biomolecules. The medical applications of cell technologies include diagnostics and biosensors; cell and gene therapy, tissue engineering, bio-artificial organs, haematology, immunotherapy, and vaccine and antibody production; predictive toxicology, synthetic biology, and modelling development and disease processes.However, the diversity, complexity and variability of living cells pose challenges for bringing safe, reliable, regulatory-compliant and cost-effective products to the market and to the patient. SMEs developing cell-based products and processes have limited financial resources to take the critical steps to move from proof of concept to practical application while at the same time addressing considerations such as scale-up/scale-out, automation, logistics, regulatory pathways and business models.Particular attention should be given to dialogue with regulators and compliance with safety and regulatory requirements, such as those pertaining to cell procurement, GMP, ethics, clinical trials, ATMPs and medical devices.The challenge addresses cells from any eukaryotic source though their eventual application must be to human medicine.Or:b) Clinical research for the validation of biomarkers and/or diagnostic medical devices (only at the first cut-off date in 2017 and for phase 2 applications - phasing out of the topic PHC-12-2014/2015 introduced in the Work Programme 2014-2015)Biomarkers are used in clinical practice to indicate both normal and pathological conditions. They are also used for predictive or prognostic purposes. They are being used increasingly in medicine and many potential new biomarkers are proposed every year. However, only a few of these have been validated for clinical use. To achieve validation a robust analytical method is required and a link to a pertinent clinical process or endpoint needs to be demonstrated.This validation process should provide evidence for high analytical value, appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and clinical validity. Particular attention should be given to validation of biomarkers with potential for rapid uptake into clinical practice. Both in vivo and in vitro potential biomarkers are eligible. Priority is given to the validation of disease-related biomarkers (i.e. diagnostic, susceptibility/risk, monitoring and prognostic biomarkers). Validation of the clinical performance of new diagnostic devices can also be supported, either in combination with the biomarker validation or against existing standards.The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries.

"""The potential of Europe’s Oceans, seas and coasts is significant for job and growth creation if the appropriate investments in research and innovation are made. SMEs contribution to the development of the 'Blue Growth Strategy' (COM (2012) 494) can be significant in particular in the fields of marine biotechnology, fisheries, marine and fresh water aquaculture (including production and processing of feed and food). However, one of the most important barriers for the development of innovative maritime economic activities is the lack of access to finance for SMEs to develop high-potential, but high-risk innovative ideas and to bring them close to market. The SME instrument offers financial support to SMEs with an EU dimension to put forward their most innovative ideas in the previously mentioned maritime and aquaculture/fisheries sectors with a particular focus on close-to-market solutions and potential for high growth and internationalisation.The SME instrument consists of three phases, including a coaching and mentoring service for beneficiaries. Participants can apply to phase 1 or directly to phase 2.In phase 1, a feasibility study shall be developed in order to verify the technological/practical as well as economic viability of an innovation idea/concept with considerable novelty to the industry sector in which it is presented (new products, processes, design, services and technologies or new market applications of existing technologies). The activities could, for example, comprise risk assessment, market study, user involvement, Intellectual Property (IP) management[1],innovation strategy development, partner search, feasibility of concept and the like to establish a solid high-potential innovation project aligned to the enterprise strategy and with a European dimension. Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.In phase 2, innovation projects[2]will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[3]would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.SME instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support.

"""Innovative SMEs have been recognised as being able to become the engine of the green economy and to facilitate the transition to a resource efficient, climate-smart circular economy. They can play an important role in helping the EU to exit from the economic crises and in job creation. The potential of commercialising innovative solutions from SMEs is however hindered by several barriers including the absence of the proof of concept, the difficulty to access risk finance, the lack of prototyping, insufficient scale-up studies, etc. Growth therefore needs to be stimulated by increasing the levels of innovation in SMEs, covering their different innovation needs over the whole innovation cycle.Innovative SMEs should be supported and guided to reach and accelerate their full green growth potential.

Bottlenecks in the ability to increase profitability of the enterprise through innovation shall be detected and analysed during phase 1 and addressed during phase 2 to increase the return in investment in innovation activities. The proposal should contain an initial business plan based on the proposed idea/concept. It should outline the specifications of a more elaborate business plan, which is to be the outcome of the project, and the criteria for success.Funding will be provided in the form of a lump sum of EUR 50.000. Projects should last around 6 months.In phase 2, innovation projects[3]will be supported that address the specific challenges identified and that demonstrate high potential in terms of company competitiveness and growth underpinned by a strategic business plan. Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success.

"""SMEs, including social enterprises and cultural actors, can build their growth on business model innovation, taking into account new opportunities arising from servitisation, from individual empowerment, from a more collaborative economy, from opening up government data and services and from the pervasive use of new technologies.

Activities should focus on innovation activities such as demonstration, testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication and the like aiming to bring an innovation idea (product, process, service etc.) to industrial readiness and maturity for market introduction, but may also include some research. For technological innovation, Technology Readiness Levels of 6 or above (or similar for non-technological innovations) are envisaged; please see part G of the General Annexes.Proposals shall be based on an elaborate business plan. Particular attention must be paid to IP protection and ownership; applicants will have to present convincing measures to ensure the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').Proposals shall contain a specification for the outcome of the project and criteria for success. They will include an explanation of how the results of the supported project are to be commercialised and of what kind of impact on the company is expected.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 2.5 million[4]would allow phase 2 to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts (higher or lower). Projects should last between 12 and 24 months.Phase 3 of the SME Instrument aims to increase the economic impact of the funding provided by the SME Instrument phase 1&2 grants and by the business coaching. Phase 3 is not subsequent to phase 1 and/or 2, but provides specific support to SME instrument beneficiaries during and after phase 1 or 2.All support under phase 3 of the SME instrument will be accessible through a single, dedicated entry point, which will serve as an information portal and a networking space.This platform will offer access to two main strands of services:In addition, phase 3 will create opportunities for partnering, networking and training, which are set out in the Dedicated Support Actions at the end of this call.SME instrument beneficiaries are also offered dedicated business innovation coaching and mentoring support. This service is facilitated by the Enterprise Europe Network and delivered by a dedicated coach through consultation and signposting to the beneficiaries. The coaches are recruited from a central database managed by the Commission and have all fulfilled stringent criteria with regards to business experience and competencies.Throughout the three phases of the instrument, the Network will complement the coaching support by providing access to its innovation and internationalisation service offering. This could include, for example, depending on the need of the SME, support in identifying growth potential, developing a growth plan and maximising it through internationalisation; strengthening the leadership and management skills of individuals in the senior management team and developing in-house coaching capacity; developing a marketing strategy or raising external finance.[1]https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry[2]This is not limited to the costs of acquiring and enforcing European or international IPR titles but could include auditing and risk management schemes to protect IP assets across planned supply and distribution chains and more generally IP valorisation plans to enhance return on investment and lever commercial investment into the relevant project.[3]In the case of SMEInst-05-2016-2017, research type activities in medical application and clinical validation, including support for clinical studies and trials, will be predominant and will necessitate reimbursement at 100%. The Technology Readiness Levels indication does not apply.[4]In the case of SMEInst-05-2016-2017, phase 2 proposals can request a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 5 million.[5]In the case of SMEInst-05-2016-2017, the development of innovative solutions should lead to value creation through the increased use of cell-based products/processes, biomarkers and/or diagnostic medical devices in industrial or clinical settings, and should contribute to technical and regulatory progress in these domains.""","""theme"""
"""SYNERGIES AND COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH EXISTING INITIATIVES The Union is fully engaged in this field. A KIC would contribute to address Horizon 2020 societal challenge ""Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and the bio-economy"". It would, in particular, co-operate with the proposed European Innovation Partnership (EIP) ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"". Whilst the latter will put emphasis on building bridges between cutting-edge research and practical innovation, a KIC would in particular create complementarity in educating key actors, such as entrepreneurs and consumers. Coordination is also needed, with the Joint Programming Initiative ""Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change"", which will pool national research efforts to integrate adaptation, mitigation and food security in the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will promote environmental and social sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture, thus highlighting the need for technical developments coupled with new entrepreneurial skills in these fields, in line with the evolution of consumers' behaviour, providing possibilities for synergies. Likewise, coordination will also be possible with the recently launched JPI ""Healthy Food for a Healthy Life"" and ""Connecting Climate Research in Europe"", and with European Technology Platforms in relating areas (in particular, the Food for Life Platform) or numerous projects under the Seventh Framework Programme. Similarly, it would build on eco-innovation market replication projects, under the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Programme), where food and drink has been one of the priority areas. Such experience will continue with Horizon 2020 namely in the context of the Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials societal challenge. A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on innovative products and services and entrepreneurial education as well as on consumer issues. CONCLUSION A KIC which focuses on the food supply chain is most suited to address the challenges outlined above. It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes: — It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge (the need to ensure a resilient and sustainable food system while meeting the increasing food demand within the constraints of available land, protecting the natural environment and safeguarding human health), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda and its objectives on climate and energy, employment, innovation and education. — This KIC focus is aligned with priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the food sector, in particular with the EIP ""Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability"". — It is able to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the businesses sector and offers possibilities for various emerging products and services – namely, in the deployment of new and innovative technologies, processes and knowledge to increase sustainable food production, processing, packaging and distribution, to reduce waste and promote better nutrition and a healthier population. — It creates sustainable and systemic impact, measured in terms of new educated entrepreneurial people, new technologies and new business. It will foster new technological developments and more efficient and sustainable production systems. — It aims at overcoming the high level of fragmentation of the whole food supply chain; favouring traceability; and will bring together a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the whole chain. — It thus requires transdisciplinary work involving different areas of knowledge, such as agronomy, ecology, biology, chemistry, nutrition, and socio-economy. — It will address the European paradox, since it will find new innovative approaches to ensure a more sustainable and efficient supply chain and to improve food security. The global food supply chain is facing a complex set of challenges. On the demand side, the situation is characterised by an increasing world population, by an increasing standard of living (especially in the emerging countries) creating demand for a more varied, high-quality diet requiring additional food production. As a result the UN has predicted that food demand will rise by around 70 % by 2050 ( 1 - Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). 2009. Global agriculture towards 2050. ). At the same time, the fast expansion of the bioenergy sector further accentuates the demand for by-products derived from the food production process. On the supply side, global climate change will aggravate pressures on food production and food supply. In addition, a number of food production systems in the world are unsustainable. Without change, the global food system will continue to degrade the environment and compromise the world's capacity to produce food in the future. These problems in particular have to be seen in connection with consumers' attitudes, concerns and behaviours, as production is driven by consumers and markets. During the last two decades the complexity of food consumption has increased dramatically. Consumers demand affordable, diversified, high quality and convenient food products responding to their tastes and needs. Concerns regarding various issues, ranging from food safety and environmental protection to ethical considerations, such as fair trading practices or animal welfare, are continuously increasing and result in growing demands by consumer groups for political action. Finally, food consumption habits (including food wastage) can have strong impacts on consumer health and well-being, as well as on primary production and on the environment. Horizon 2020 addresses this complexity and defines the challenges relating to this sector: ""The challenge is to secure supplies of safe and high quality food and bio-based products and to ensure sustainable management of biological resources, contributing to both rural and coastal development and to competitiveness of the European biobased industries, while preserving terrestrial and marine eco-systems, reducing fossil-dependency, mitigating and adapting to climate change and promoting zero-waste and resource efficiency."" RELEVANCE AND IMPACT A KIC on a sustainable supply chain will help meeting Horizon 2020 priorities, namely those defined in the context of the societal challenge ""Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research and the bio-economy"". This thematic field is in addition highly relevant in terms of economic and societal impact. Questions of food safety and security have a bearing on nearly all sectors of our economy and society, and very often call for regulatory action. The food industry is the largest manufacturing sector in Europe and plays an essential role in Europe's wider economic development. Despite its relevant role, the competitiveness of the European food and drink industry is being challenged. Over the last decade, Europe's share of the global market has declined from 25 % to 21 % in the face of competition from emerging economies, such as China, India and Brazil. Increasingly unable to compete on cost alone, the European food industry needs to be able to add value by creating healthier, more sustainable and resource-efficient products if it is to reverse this decline. Action is needed to ensure a climate resilient and sustainable global food system while meeting the increasing food demand within the constraints of available land and declining fish stocks, protecting the natural environment and safeguarding human health. A KIC in this area will focus on the food supply chain. This focus lends itself particularly well to the holistic approach of a KIC. It comprises resource input in the very beginning of the chain (fertilisers, etc.), food production, processing, packaging and distribution; and it ends with the consumers which might be a specific priority of a KIC (reduction of food waste, healthy nutrition, etc.). The objective is to ensure a more efficient and effective food supply chain system, while improving the sustainability and traceability in all parts of this chain. Addressing the food supply chain via a KIC will thus give the possibility to address not only some of the major economic and societal relevant challenges Europe is facing, but also to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the business sector – namely, in the deployment of new and innovative technologies, processes and knowledge to increase sustainable food production, processing, packaging and distribution, to reduce waste and promote better nutrition. Through its integrative approach, a KIC in this area will be able to influence the industry approach to focus more on consumer-driven innovation, thereby benefiting consumer health and quality of life. This will go along with the potential of new business models and market strategies that focus on consumers' needs and trends and build upon enhanced awareness of the food chain, which can have potential to get innovations and technological possibilities in line with consumer interests and thus create new business opportunities. A KIC in this area will be very important to overcome the high level of fragmentation of the whole food supply chain. It will blend a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the whole chain. All elements of the chain (primary sector, food production, food processors, retailers, food service channels and – not least – the consumer) are inextricably linked to each other for the conception of future innovations. A KIC will provide the necessary systemic and transdiciplinary approach to tackle these issues. The major added value of a KIC in this area will be its role in addressing the current shortage of skills and human resources. Currently, probably as many as half of the European food and beverage manufacturing industries are facing a shortage in scientific and skilled personnel. This is a barrier to innovation in this sector. By integrating education with the other sectors of the knowledge triangle, a KIC will address this issue. It will at the same time offer the opportunity to stimulate new educated entrepreneurial people, capable of developing new innovative technologies and business. This focus on entrepreneurship would be particularly relevant in the food sector, which is characterised by a high number of SMEs. The major risks associated to the success of a KIC under this theme are mainly related to the necessary accompanying innovation framework conditions, which KICs are not directly addressing. For increasing sustainability throughout the food supply chain, some changes in regulation may be needed in order, for example, to internalise food production costs. Therefore, the KICs need to liaise with ongoing Union and national innovation and policy activities on these matters (see next section). ""","""theme"""
"""SYNERGIES AND COMPLEMENTARITIES WITH EXISTING INITIATIVES A KIC as described above would be complementary to a number of other Union initiatives, as well as at the level of Member States and industry associations. In addition to the already mentioned ETP ""Manufuture"", it could also establish links with the ETPs on Smart Systems Integration and the Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) on Embedded Computing Systems. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) on Factories of the Future and others potentially to be launched under Horizon 2020 within this thematic area as well as a number of Framework Programmes (FP) projects would also be natural co-operation partners. The KIC would take into account the research priorities and action plans defined in the framework of the ETPs and the research work carried out so far by the JTI, PPP and FP projects in this area. Similarly, it would build on eco-innovation market replication projects, under the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), where experience in the area of more sustainable manufacturing has been developed. Such experience will continue with Horizon 2020 namely in the context of the Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials societal challenges. Synergies may also be considered with the Environmental Technologies Verification (ETV) pilot programme, which aims at promoting high value environmental technologies by providing a third-party validation of their performance. An added-value manufacturing KIC could be also a connection point for synergy effects with the European Technology Research Council, which the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies recommends for promoting excellence in technological research and innovation. A KIC in this area would be complementary to these activities since it would focus on transdisciplinary activities within the knowledge triangle with a strong focus on entrepreneurial education. CONCLUSION A KIC which focuses on the integration of all stakeholders concerned with manufacturing and which puts a strong focus on re-shaping the education agenda in this field would be well-suited to address the challenges outlined above. It also meets the criteria put forward for the selection of KIC themes in the SIA: — It addresses a major economic and societal relevant challenge Europe is facing (to increase the competitiveness of the Member States on the global market and contribute to the development of a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly manufacturing process), and contributes to the delivery of the Europe 2020 agenda of smart and sustainable growth. — This KIC focus is aligned with the priorities defined in Horizon 2020 and complementary with other Union activities in the area. — It can build on a solid industrial sector which will be attracted by a KIC. — It offers possibilities for various emerging products, services and business models, and – above all – it will be well- suited to address the urgent need for qualified people in this sector. — It takes a systemic approach and thus requires transdisciplinary work and the development of new education across the boundaries of disciplines. — It will bring together a critical mass of excellent research, innovation, education and training stakeholders along the value chain, which would otherwise not unite. — It will address the European paradox, since it will capitalise on the Union's strong research base and find new innovative approaches to ensure a more competitive, sustainable and resource-efficient manufacturing sector. One of the major challenges defined in the European Innovation Agenda and which also has to be addressed within the framework of Horizon 2020, is the competitiveness of Union Member States on the global market. One of the sectors where the problem is particularly urgent is manufacturing. Manufacturing in European countries is under considerable strain: increased competition from other developed economies, low cost production in developing countries, and scarcity of raw materials are putting pressure on the European manufacturing companies. Parallel to this, there are further factors driving change in the manufacturing sector: new market and societal needs, rapid advances in science and technology, environmental and sustainability requirements. One possible answer to address these challenges is the development of a ""high value (or added-value) manufacturing"" industry. This concept defines an integrated system including the whole cycle of production, distribution and end-of- life treatment of goods and products/services applying a customer/user driven innovation system. Rather than competing primarily on cost, added value manufacturers deliver value by delivering product/service innovation, establishing process excellence, achieving high brand recognition and/or contributing to a sustainable society. The manufacturing sector is of considerable economic, social and environmental significance. In 2010 the manufacturing sector accounted for 15,4 % of the Union's GDP and over 33 million jobs. This figure increases to 37 % if power generation, construction, and associated business services are included. At the same time, manufacturing also contributed to about 25 % of the waste, 23 % of greenhouse gases and 26 % of NOx generated in Europe. Bearing this in mind, it is quite clear that the overall objectives in the field of manufacturing must be increased competitiveness of Europe within the global market as well as the development of more sustainable and environment- friendly manufacturing processes. RELEVANCE AND IMPACT A KIC on added-value manufacturing will help meeting Horizon 2020 priorities in terms of advanced manufacturing and processing, and its specific objective of ""transforming today's industrial forms of production towards more knowledge intensive, sustainable, low-emission, trans-sectoral manufacturing and processing technologies, to realise innovative products, processes and services"". It will be able to mobilise investment and long-term commitment from the business sector, and to expand and create new markets. It could have in particular a function in supporting the actions defined in the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technology Platform (ETP) ""Manufuture"": — Eco-design — Development of added-value products and services; — Development of new business models; — Development of advanced manufacturing engineering processes; — New emerging manufacturing sciences and technologies; — Transformation of existing research and education infrastructures to support world-class manufacturing. Whilst supporting the development of new products, services, business models and manufacturing processes, emphasis should be put on sustainability and eco-innovation, with the reduction of resource and energy inefficiencies, maximising positive environmental impacts, but also contributing to strengthening positive economic and social impacts. Concretely, such clean approach will imply energy and material efficient processes and machinery, the use of renewable power sources, and/or the employment of smart energy management, leading thus to significant reductions of waste and emissions. By contributing to the development and deployment of more sustainable, resource-efficient and competitive manufacturing, a KIC would be able to trigger industry and consumers behavioural change and to create systemic impact. A KIC on added-value manufacturing could also have a very important role and impact at regional level: Fostering the creation of interconnected regional clusters with local transfers and collaboration, developing competences in high- end manufacturing technologies, and developing excellence in manufacturing technologies would be the key missions of a KIC at regional level. In this connection, specific attention could be given to those regions more affected by declining manufacturing capacity as well as to SMEs. One of the major challenges for reaching the above aims is the availability of a highly qualified workforce which is sufficient in quality as well as in numbers. A KIC would therefore have a very important role to play in re-shaping the education landscape in this field. By creating closer links between skills demanders and education providers, a KIC would promote joint post-graduate degrees, post-graduate professional training and industrial ""real-life"" courses. Capacity-building will be also a central element of a KIC in added-value manufacturing. This concerns not only the supply of high qualified work force, but also the possibility of establishing the KIC as a forum for interaction and promotion of cross-disciplinary skills and competences, particularly for the combination of multiple key enabling technologies as proposed by the High-Level Group on Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/ict/files/kets/hlg_report_final_en.pdf). A KIC on this area will have the potential to bring together different actors and stakeholders in this very transdisciplinary sector, including key upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. This includes processing industries (e.g. steel or chemicals) which are immediately linked with the value chain for added-value manufacturing. ""","""theme"""
"""The integration and use of renewable energy in buildings for heat and power generation still encounter unsolved technological problems linked to the security and reliability of energy supply and related costs. Partly, it is due to unpredictable fluctuation of some renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind. The difficulty is even greater in cases where a 100% security of energy supply is essential such as for hospitals and especially when several renewable energy sources are used.This inducement prize will reward a hospital that has an innovative and within its premises perfectly integrated combined heat and power (CHP) installation. This installation has to use at least three different European renewable energy technologies, include energy storage component(s) and be able to provide 100% of hospital's annual needs for energy consumption. In this context any renewable energy source is allowed.The prize will induce innovative renewable energy solutions integrating several technologies into one energy system. Installing such kind of integrated equipment in the ecosystem of a hospital would not only ensure the security of its energy supply, but would also raise public awareness on renewable energy. Moreover, the prize aims to mobilise and enhance private and public investments for replication of similar solutions in Europe and worldwide.The specific rules of contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.Indicative prize amount: EUR 1 million.The prize winner will be the entrant (a hospital) that has installed and operated in its premises a new combined heat and power system integrating at least three different renewable energy technologies and with an innovative energy storage component. The proposed energy system solution shall be adaptable and replicable to other sites. Clear energy security and economic benefits shall be proven to assure these replications.The prize will accelerate the introduction of renewable energy sources at larger scale. It will also encourage new venues for installing flexible and reliable CHP units from different renewable energy sources with zero carbon footprint. The contest gives as well a good opportunity to local small and medium-sized enterprises to demonstrate their expertise and know-how.This activity directly aimed at supporting pilot activities is excluded from the delegation to INEA and will be implemented by the Commission services.""","""theme"""
